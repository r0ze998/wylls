//! Clashes (M1 contract §5.11): GatherClash (0x60), ResolveFromInputs
//! (0x61), ResolveClash (0x62, feature `oracle`, tests only), SkipQuiet
//! (0x63), CloseClashInputs (0x64), CloseArrivalDay (0x65),
//! CloseArrivalSlot (0x66), and the **return settle** of hosts that leave
//! a province (Dissolve's `Leave`, a bounced resident), contract v1.5 §21.
//! Implemented by W4-A.
//!
//! [`model`] is the clash of one province-bell as a pure function of
//! account bytes (the `ClashInput` builder, the write-back, the settle of
//! pending changes, the camp's daily check): since integ-W5 (W4-A D8) it
//! lives in `frontier_abi::clash_model`, so the program, the herald, the
//! verifier, itest and the WASM client run one copy (W3-D D1).
//!
//! ## Pinned here (recorded in `W4-A-NOTES.md`; v1.6 amendment requests)
//!
//! - **Residents** are the entries in state 1 with `from_bell ≤ b` at
//!   `Host::values_at(b)`, at Hold, `dealt_bps` as stored. **Garrisons**
//!   are the site mirrors in state 1 (holding) among `site_count`, at
//!   `GarrisonState::at(b)`, walls when `walls_committed > 0` or a wall
//!   item with `delta > 0` is effective at or before b, id = the holding
//!   key (`host_id(P, Q, site, gen, 0)`), at Hold. **The camp** (present)
//!   is a NEUTRAL garrison with id `u64::MAX − gen`, troops `× 1,000`, no
//!   walls, at Hold, when fewer than 12 garrisons stand (12 holdings and a
//!   camp: the camp sits the bell out; `MAX_GARRISONS` = 12). **Arrivals**
//!   are the records with `present = 1`.
//! - **The camp's daily check** (I-56) runs at the first resolve or skip of
//!   a day (`day(b) ≥ next_check_day`): `camp::place(camp_seed, P, terrain,
//!   day(b), has_holding, false)` with `camp_seed = sha256("PSF-CAMP-v1" ‖
//!   province[TERRAIN..=SITE_COUNT])` (the ring seed is in neither
//!   instruction's accounts; this block is fixed at OpenProvince and derived
//!   from the ring seed, so it is as public as the ring seed); a spawn
//!   replaces a present camp (the simulator's respawn), `gen += 1`, a
//!   `CAMP` record; `next_check_day = day(b) + 1` either way.
//! - **Write-back** of a resident: its post-clash troops, stamina and
//!   cooldown (`Host::apply_clash`) only when something changed (a quiet
//!   bell leaves the entry's lazy stamina clock untouched, so a skip and a
//!   resolve leave the same bytes, G11); `Withdrew` moves its tile;
//!   `Destroyed` frees the entry unless a departure (`Spend`) or a leave is
//!   pending (those keep their post-clash values for SettleDeparture and
//!   the return settle); `Bounced` / `Retreated` send it home: a pending
//!   `Leave` issued at b (unless it is departing or forfeit).
//!   **Arrivals** that stay or withdraw become roster entries (state 1,
//!   `from_bell = b + 1`, `ready_bell = b + 2` if engaged else `b + 1`,
//!   `dealt_bps` = the faction doctrine at Hold, not arriving). **Garrisons**
//!   take their post-clash troops; **the camp** is cleared (`state 0`) when
//!   its troops fall below one whole troop or hostile hosts hold its hex,
//!   and `WORKS_CAMP` goes to the arrivals of the holding factions that
//!   stay on the camp's tile: their positions are the `camp_mask` stored in
//!   ClashInputs' reserved word at offset 76 (layout request) and logged in
//!   the `CAMP` record of the clear (`troops = 0`).
//! - **Settle of bell b** (resolve and skip alike): musters with
//!   `from_bell ≤ b + 1` join the roster; `Spend` → state 3 (departed,
//!   post-clash values, SettleDeparture next); `Leave` → state 3 with op
//!   `Leave` kept until the return settle; `Forfeit` → freed (troops
//!   lost); splits and merges by the kernel; garrison changes of bells ≤ b
//!   (`GarrisonState::settle`). `roster_epoch` moves (and `n_entries` is
//!   recounted) only when an entry, a garrison or the camp changed, so a
//!   skip and a resolve of the same quiet bell leave the same Province.
//! - **The return settle** is SettleDeparture with `transit_slot = 0xFF`
//!   ([`RETURN_SLOT`], same accounts `[payer s] [season] [province w]
//!   [holding w]`): the state-3 `Leave` entries of that Holding in that
//!   Province are freed, at most [`RETURN_MAX`] per transaction (v1.7),
//!   and `reserve[unit] += troops / 1,000` (whole troops, rounded down)
//!   credited to the Holding when it is live with the host's
//!   generation (`DEPARTURE_SETTLED` with `destroyed = 2`), else the troops
//!   are lost (`STRANDED`). Nothing to return is `AlreadyDone`.
//! - **Gather records:** a slot whose Holding is absent, released or
//!   re-founded, or whose transit record is gone, gathers as not present;
//!   a transit still departed (state 1) is `DepartureUnsettled`; one
//!   destroyed at the origin (state 3) is recorded with `present = 0`,
//!   `fate = Destroyed`. The arrival's stamina is the transit's
//!   `stamina_after` refilled from `depart_bell + 1` to the arrival bell
//!   (the kernel's `Stamina::at`). A present slot listed without a Holding,
//!   or an absent one with a Holding, is `BadData` (G6: a gather that
//!   omits a present slot cannot complete).
//! - **Bells at or after `end_bell`** are never gathered, resolved or
//!   skipped (`WrongStatus`): no arrival can exist there.
//! - **SkipQuiet** re-tests quietness at its first bell and after every
//!   change of the roster, garrisons or camp (an in-transaction cache; the
//!   Province's `quiet_ok` byte is left 0: nothing records the epoch it
//!   would be valid for). The test is [`model::trivially_quiet`] (every
//!   occupied hex one faction's, within the caps: no engagement, bounce or
//!   withdrawal can happen) and, only at the transaction's first bell, the
//!   kernel's `is_quiet` (heap scoped: the bump allocator frees only its
//!   top block). A later bell that is not trivially quiet ends the
//!   transaction, which commits the bells before it ([`SKIP_KERNEL_TESTS`]:
//!   the CU-aware stop of I-50 as a work bound, since
//!   `sol_remaining_compute_units` is not active on mainnet). The day's
//!   camp check of the bell where the transaction stops is undone (v1.7),
//!   so the committed bells leave exactly what resolving them would. Settles
//!   run only from the first bell something is due ([`model::next_due`]).
//! - **Digests:** CLASH's `input_digest = sha256("PSF-CLASH-INPUT-v1" ‖
//!   le32(b) ‖ seed ‖ province[SITE_MIRROR..TICKET_COHORTS] before ‖
//!   inputs[ARRIVALS..POSTURES])`; SKIP's `quiet_digest = sha256(
//!   "PSF-QUIET-v1" ‖ le32(b0) ‖ n ‖ province[SITE_MIRROR..TICKET_COHORTS]
//!   after)`.
//!
//! ## MC "Contested Ground" (ABI v2, CQ2-B)
//!
//! A Province of 4,736 B (`layout_version = 2`) is an MC Province and
//! takes the v2 path; a 4,096-B Province keeps M1's path byte for byte
//! (the program dispatches on the account, R-22; once every Province is
//! v2 the M1 path is only the record of M1). The v2 path is the shared
//! models' calling order (`conquest_model`'s module note, CQ1-C §1):
//!
//! ```text
//! resolve: input_digest_v2 → build_v2 → kernel clash → report_from_outcome
//!          → apply_v2 → settle_bell(b) → conquest_model::step(b)
//!          → finish_bell(b, changed ∨ step.roster_changed)
//! skip:    camp_check_v2 → quiet test (trivially_quiet_v2, else the
//!          kernel's is_quiet on build_v2) → report (tile masks, cached
//!          until the roster changes) → settle_bell(b) → step(b) → finish_bell
//! ```
//!
//! - **The conquest step** (§5.7) reads the Season's conquest block
//!   (`StepParams::of_season`, `conquest_version` 1, else `BadAccount`).
//! - **Logs** (§6): after CLASH (resolve) or in bell order inside the skip
//!   (before the skip's CAMP and SKIP records): CONQUEST (82) for every bell
//!   whose step `emits()`; at a keep taken, KEEP (84, cause 1: holder,
//!   from, the new garrison in whole troops, `consolidated_until`, gen) and,
//!   when the donor goes home with a rest, RETIRE (86, `by` 2: the rest in
//!   milli-troops as the entry holds it, the donor's Holding key). Each
//!   chains the Province. The bodies are written here ([`cqlog`]); the
//!   program's `events::emit_cq` carries the same bytes
//!   (`cq_records_are_the_abis`), but the swap changes the measured path of
//!   the tightest budget (RFI 286,224 of 290,000) and waits for CQ4-A's
//!   re-measure (integ-CQ2-NOTES §3).
//! - **SkipQuiet v2** recomputes its quiet test after a change of the
//!   roster, a garrison or the camp, and after a step whose
//!   `quiet_inputs_changed` (a keep changed hands, a mirror flipped at a
//!   capture, the donor left). It commits its prefix before a bell that
//!   would take `Σ active records` past [`SKIP_RECORD_BELLS_MAX`] (288;
//!   §5.4, I-50), the first bell always runs.
//! - **GatherClash** (§5.6): a slot whose host id names a captured
//!   Holding's previous generation (`capture_flags` bit 0, `prev_gen`)
//!   gathers as present.
//! - **Digests:** CLASH's `PSF-CLASH-INPUT-v2` and SKIP's `PSF-QUIET-v2`
//!   (`clash_model::{input_digest_v2, quiet_digest_v2}`).
