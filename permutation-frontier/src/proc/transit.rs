//! Transits (M1 contract §5.11, §5.12): SettleTransit (0x54, class D, the
//! seal proof of I-44) and SweepPoolOwed (0x55, class N). Implemented by
//! W4-B.
//!
//! ## SettleTransit
//!
//! Accounts `[0 payer s,w] [1 season] [2 holding w] [3 dest province w] [4
//! inputs w] [5 slot w] [6 home province w] [7 anchor|archive r] [8
//! slot_beneficiary w] [9 resolver w] [10 holding_rent_payer w] [11
//! settle_beneficiary w] [12 system] ([13 citizen w])`; data `transit_slot,
//! commit, seal, beneficiary`. Position 13 (v1.7) is the owner's Citizen,
//! required when the host earns the camp's Works (below). Checks in the
//! order of §5.11:
//!
//! 1. the Holding (present, canonical from its stored key) and its transit
//!    record in state 2 or 3 (`DepartureUnsettled` for 1, `TransitState`
//!    for 0);
//! 2. `now ≥ close(arrive, r_dest) + 600` and `dest.resolved_next > arrive`
//!    (`TooEarly`); `A` from THE anchor `an‖(arrive, r_dest)` or, once it
//!    is archived, from the region-half-day archive's entry (`NoAnchor`
//!    when neither holds the bell);
//! 3. `sha256(commit ‖ sha256(seal)) == seal_root` (`CommitMismatch`);
//! 4. **the proof**: the round-T(arrive) signature from THE anchor or the
//!    archive entry opens the seal ([`crate::crypto::seal::judge`]: FO
//!    check, commitment, `Plain::validate`); a valid seal's destination
//!    must be the supplied Province (`BadAddress`);
//! 5. `settle_beneficiary == beneficiary` (`BadAddress`); the ClashInputs
//!    `ci‖(dest, arrive)` count only when present with flag 2 (I-46).
//!
//! Outcomes (D5, order-free; `TRANSIT_SETTLED.outcome`):
//!
//! | branch | host | tip | march fee | bond |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | bad seal (codes 1, 2, 4, 5) | destroyed; a Stays/Withdrew entry at the destination gets `Forfeit` at `now_bell` | reward | reward | reward |
//! | in the final set, fate 1–5 | Stays/Withdrew stay; Bounced/Retreated return; Destroyed gone | its slot's beneficiary | resolver | rent payer |
//! | not in the set, outranked (bounce, 6) | returns, no loss | rent payer | resolver | rent payer |
//! | not in the set, would have been admitted (routed, 7) | returns with `rout_survivors`, stamina 0 | `pool_owed` | resolver | rent payer |
//! | no resolved inputs (routed, 7) | as above | `pool_owed` | `pool_owed` | rent payer |
//!
//! "reward" = tip + march fee + bond to `settle_beneficiary`. Every payment
//! goes through `pay_or_divert` with sink `Holding.pool_owed`; no
//! DefencePool account is listed (I-48).
//!
//! ## Pinned here (recorded in `W4-B-NOTES.md`)
//!
//! - **The slot account** (v1.5): the ArrivalSlot `(dest, arrive, faction,
//!   i)` with `i` = the host's position in the resolved final set mod 4,
//!   or `i = 0` when the host is not in a resolved set (a present slot of
//!   another host there is "no slot of this host" and is never paid).
//!   With resolved inputs a host has a slot at the destination iff it is
//!   in the final set (a present slot cannot be skipped by a gather, and
//!   the latch stops reveals once inputs exist), so the index is decided
//!   by the records, not by the settler.
//! - **A final-set host whose slot is gone** (closed at season end + 72 h,
//!   CloseArrivalSlot case b): its tip goes to `pool_owed`.
//! - **The slot's rent**: SettleTransit's account list has no `rent_to`
//!   position (§5.11). A slot whose `rent_to` is one of the listed wallets
//!   (payer, slot beneficiary, resolver, rent payer, settle beneficiary) is
//!   closed to it at once when it is not kept for a claim; otherwise its
//!   `settled` flag is set and CloseArrivalSlot (case a) closes it to its
//!   `rent_to` after the claim grace. Either way the rent returns to the
//!   Reveal's fee payer (I-49).
//! - **Claim-eligible** (I-52): THE anchor present (an archived bell is
//!   past any grace), `claimed == 0`, `ev_slot − anchor.slot ≥
//!   lateness_slots`, `fees::defence_refund > 0` (a price above the tip
//!   level) and `now < close + 6 × 600`.
//! - **Returning hosts** rejoin the home Province (the Holding's own) as a
//!   muster-pending entry (state 2, `from_bell = now_bell + 1`) when a
//!   free entry and the caps (48 over states 1–2, 8 per faction) allow,
//!   else `reserve[unit] += troops / 1,000`; a host below
//!   `DESTROYED_BELOW` returns nothing. Values: Bounced/Retreated from the
//!   final set carry the record's `troops_after` and its stamina at the
//!   arrival bell; a bounce by rank carries the transit's post-origin
//!   values (no loss); a routed host `rout_survivors(troops)` and stamina
//!   0 at `now_bell`. `ready_bell = max(depart_bell + ready_bell_off,
//!   now_bell + 1)`; `dealt_bps` = the doctrine at Hold (as Muster).
//! - **Payment recipients** are checked only when paid (`BadAddress`):
//!   `slot_beneficiary == slot.beneficiary`, `resolver ==
//!   inputs.resolver`; `holding_rent_payer == Holding.rent_payer` always.
//!   A recipient owned by this program is never credited directly: the
//!   amount stays in the Holding as `pool_owed` (`DIVERT`), so every
//!   lamport a transit escrowed is accounted.
//! - `TRANSIT_SETTLED` payments: `*_to` is the first 8 bytes of the
//!   intended recipient (the Holding's own address for `pool_owed`);
//!   the bad-seal branch logs `tip`, `fee`, `bond` as 0 and the whole
//!   escrow as `reward`; `pool_owed_delta` counts routed and diverted
//!   lamports.
//!
//! **v1.7 (wave-4 review):**
//!
//! - **W4-B F1 closed by the gather stamp.** A GatherClash that records a
//!   transit (state 2 or 3) stamps `FLAG_GATHERED` and its `(DEST_P,
//!   DEST_Q)` into the transit record; SettleTransit settles a stamped
//!   transit only against that Province (`BadAddress`). A bad seal whose
//!   owner revealed it elsewhere can no longer be settled against another
//!   Province to escape the `Forfeit`; an unstamped transit was recorded
//!   by no gather, so no roster holds it and any present Province may
//!   route it.
//! - **An absent destination** (a valid seal to a Province never opened,
//!   or outside `r_max`): position 3 is the canonical address of the
//!   plaintext's Province, absent; the anchor or archive names its own
//!   region, which must be the plaintext destination's; nothing waits for
//!   a resolve; the transit settles as routed with no resolved inputs. A
//!   bad seal still needs a present Province (`BadAccount`).
//! - **The camp's loot** (I-56): the arrival at the lowest position of the
//!   ClashInputs' `camp_mask` whose fate is Stays earns `WORKS_CAMP` for
//!   the Holding's owner Citizen (position 13, `BadAccount` when missing);
//!   `TRANSIT_SETTLED` then chains the Citizen. One winner per camp, as the
//!   simulator (`sim.rs` credits the first camp winner on the tile).
