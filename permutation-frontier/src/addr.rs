//! Addresses (M1 contract §4.1, I-01, I-02).
//!
//! `addr(kind, key) = sha256(season_pda ‖ seed ‖ program_id)` with `seed =
//! tag(2) ‖ lowercase hex of the little-endian key fields`: the grammar is
//! the kernel's (`permutation_rules::frontier::addr`) through
//! `frontier_abi::addr`, byte for byte SP-V2's. The Season is the only PDA,
//! `["season", le64(id)]`, its bump found once by AnnounceSeason and stored;
//! nobody ever passes a bump.
//!
//! **Presence** is authenticated by owner = program, magic, `season_id` and
//! the stored key fields; readers that need *the* instance also recompute
//! the address. **Absence** is the canonical address, owner System, no
//! data; lamports are ignored (pre-funded = absent).
//!
//! On chain the address hash is the `sol_sha256` syscall (≈ 0.5k CU per
//! address with the seed formatting).
