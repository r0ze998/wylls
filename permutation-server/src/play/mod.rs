//! The playable server for Game Design V5 (`bin/play`): nations, members, offices.
//!
//! Serves the web client from `web/`, `llms.txt` for agents, and a JSON API.
//! Every view, preview and AI decision is made from the full state (perfect
//! information, `fog`): everything is public on chain anyway.
//!
//! People and agents are **members** of one of the season's nations (V5 §4).
//! Members elect four officers; an officer orders within its office, every
//! member proposes, supports, votes and recalls (V5 §5).
//!
//! * AI member — a reference AI hosted by this server (`driver`).
//! * local mode: a person joins in the browser (`POST /api/join` in the
//!   lobby), which returns a member token (`X-Member-Token`).
//! * chain mode: every other member — a person with their own wallet, or an
//!   outside agent (both register through x402) — signs its own
//!   transactions in the browser or the SDK. This server holds no tokens for
//!   them: it serves any member's public view (`?member=M`, the same for
//!   every member), dry-runs its drafts (`/api/validate` with `member`), and
//!   refuses every action route the same way for everyone.
//!
//! Vacant offices are filled by the rules' caretaker (`gov::caretaker`):
//! the members' top proposal for the office, else a minimal default.
//!
//! Two modes:
//! * local (default): the engine runs in this process. The season opens in
//!   a lobby; it starts when a member presses start (or at once with
//!   `--autostart`). Entry fees are simulated test USDC.
//! * `--chain http://127.0.0.1:4191`: the world is the on-chain program's
//!   (read through permutation-gateway), ticks resolve on the MagicBlock ER,
//!   and members act on chain with their own session keys. The server
//!   listens at once: until the government opens, `/api/lobby` says
//!   `registering` (no world yet) or `starting`, and the rest of `/api/*`
//!   answers 503; then the full game is served, without a restart.
//!   `--gateway-proxy URL` serves the gateway's public listener under `/gw`
//!   (`proxy`), so the page and the gateway share one origin.
//!
//! | Module | Contents |
//! |---|---|
//! | `game` | the game: members and who runs them, the lobby, resolving ticks |
//! | `chain` | chain mode: following the chain, sending batches through the gateway |
//! | `roster` | the operator's AI members: salts, home cities, announcements (V5 §18.2) |
//! | `talk` | members' messages and the AI members' answers (V5 §18.7) |
//! | `views` | `/api/state` and `/api/lobby` |
//! | `routes` | the JSON API |
//! | `proxy` | `/gw/*`: the gateway's public listener on this origin |
//! | `http` | parsing requests, writing responses (with the security headers) |
//!
//! One lock guards the game. No route writes to a client or calls the
//! gateway while holding it.
