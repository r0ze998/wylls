//! Wylls on Solana + MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups.
//!
//! The World PDA holds the borsh-encoded `permutation_rules::WorldState`; the
//! same crate the server, replay verifier and agents use runs here, so a
//! tick resolved on chain is byte-identical to one resolved anywhere else.
//! See `DESIGN.md` for the account model and the season lifecycle.
//!
//! Two layers, split by the `program` feature (on by default):
//!
//! * **Always compiled**: the account layouts and the pure modules below
//!   (`error`, `finalize`, `heap`, `instruction`, `lifecycle`, `payout`,
//!   `randomness`, `rules`, `seat`, `state`, `token`). They must never `use`
//!   the MagicBlock SDK, `solana_system_interface` or `crate::processor`
//!   (test-only uses are gated `#[cfg(all(test, feature = "program"))]`).
//!   The play server, the replay verifier and the LiteSVM suite
//!   (`svm-tests`) build this crate without `program`, so code they call
//!   must live here, never in `processor`. Their builds fail if the rule is
//!   broken.
//! * **`program`**: the instruction handlers (`processor`) and the
//!   entrypoint, with the MagicBlock SDK.
