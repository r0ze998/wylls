//! Province terrain: symmetric by construction (design §3.2).
//!
//! A province in wedge k at ring d is generated from its canonical copy in
//! wedge 0 (`ProvinceCoord::turned(k)`) with the ring seed `R_d`, and the
//! result is turned back. All six wedges of a ring therefore get identical
//! terrain, resources and sites: *every faction's wedge offers the same land
//! at the same ring at the same moment.* The Concord (ring 0) is made from
//! its own wedge-0 sextant, so it has the six-fold symmetry by itself.
//!
//! * **Terrain** is `mapgen`'s integer value noise (elevation, moisture)
//!   at the canonical hex, classified by thresholds into the six terrains
//!   of `map::Terrain`.
//! * **Connectivity by rule:** a province border is 9 adjacent tile pairs,
//!   5 tiles on each side. The middle 3 tiles of every side ([`GATES`])
//!   are always passable (a blocked one becomes a pass: mountain → hills,
//!   water → grassland). Both provinces of a border force their own middle
//!   tiles, whatever ring seed each was made with, so every border has at
//!   least 5 passable crossings.
//! * **Connectivity across the province:** from every gate tile and every
//!   site a fixed path to the province centre ([`carve_path`]: each step
//!   one tile closer to the centre, preferring a passable tile, then the
//!   lower tile index) is made passable the same way. So every site and
//!   every gate lies in the centre's passable component, and any two sites
//!   on the map are connected by land. The Concord carves the union of its
//!   paths turned six ways, keeping its six-fold symmetry.
//! * **Sites:** up to 12 settlement sites by score, at least 2 apart, ties
//!   to the lower canonical tile index. The Concord has none (neutral).
