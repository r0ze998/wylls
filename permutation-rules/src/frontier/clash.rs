//! The clash at the bell (design §6.3, §6.4).
//!
//! Everything that arrives at a province in bell b resolves together
//! against the province's **roster frozen at the start of b** (hosts and
//! garrisons whose `host::Presence` covers b). [`resolve_clash`] is a pure
//! function of that roster, the bell's revealed arrivals and postures, the
//! diplomatic relations, the province's storage room ([`Occupancy`]) and
//! the bell seed `S(b, r)`. Nothing in it depends on when the reveals or
//! the resolve landed, or on the order of any list it is given, so lag only
//! waits and never changes an outcome (§8.4).
//!
//! Steps:
//! 1. **Retreat orders.** An arrival with a `retreat_ratio` r withdraws
//!    without fighting if the frozen hostile strength on its target hex
//!    exceeds r × its own. (Evaluated against the frozen roster only, so it
//!    is done first and frees its slot.)
//! 2. **Merge** by the province caps (≤ 48 hosts, ≤ 8 per faction) and the
//!    hex fair-share rule, allocated by **side**, not by faction (allied
//!    factions cannot pool slots against a third, §6.1): the factions on a
//!    hex fall into sides, the connected groups of factions that are not
//!    hostile to each other. Each side is guaranteed
//!    `min(its hosts, ⌊6 / sides⌋)` slots and the rest go by mass. On a
//!    holding's hex the sides hostile to the owner together get at most 3
//!    (shared by the same rule) and the owner's side the rest, the owner's
//!    own hosts first. Ties go by `tie_key(seed, host_id)`. Hosts that find
//!    no room bounce home with no loss.
//!    - **(2a) The room** (I-43): the province caps count the residents and
//!      the musters still pending (they join after this clash), and an
//!      arrival is admitted only while the province stores fewer than
//!      `Occupancy::storage_free` new entries, so a Province never holds
//!      more than its 56 entries and a faction never more than 8 hosts once
//!      its musters join. Arrivals are taken in mass order.
//!    - **(2b)** the hex fair share above.
//!    - **(2c) The recount** (CL-10): a host the hex fair share bounced
//!      frees its province, faction and storage slot; the arrivals the room
//!      refused are re-admitted in mass order into the free slots of their
//!      hexes (never displacing a host the fair share admitted), in one
//!      pass.
//! 3. **Engagements.** On every hex each hostile pair of combatants fights
//!    one `combat::resolve_engagement`, reused unchanged **with both of its
//!    halves** (the attack and the defender's retaliation, with v9's
//!    retaliation modifiers: a garrison fighting as `Combatant::City`
//!    retaliates at ×0.5 and never attacks, a ranged defender retaliates at
//!    ×0.5), **from pre-clash counts**. The arrival attacks a resident; a
//!    garrison is always the defender; two arrivals or two residents
//!    engage both ways at half weight each. Every clash engagement is on
//!    one hex, so none is a ranged attack (`RANGED_ATTACK` applies to v9's
//!    attacks from range only). What a combatant deals in each of its
//!    engagements is divided by its number of engagements on the hex, then
//!    scaled by the stance table (`stance`). The variance dice of every
//!    engagement are drawn from the bell seed, both from one hash per
//!    engagement (Phase B, `CLASH_VERSION` 3).
//! 4. **All damage applies at once.** Hosts below 0.5 troops are destroyed.
//! 5. **One side holds the field;** hosts hostile to it withdraw to an
//!    adjacent friendly hex of the province, or bounce home. Units with no
//!    attack and no defence (Scouts; CL-10) never contest a hex, never
//!    count in the ranking and never hold a holding's hex for a siege or
//!    defend it; they withdraw when their faction loses the hex or when
//!    they are hostile to the side that holds it.
//! 6. **Damage-ratio refund:** a faction whose damage ratio on the hex is
//!    ≥ 10 pays no engagement stamina.
//!
//! **Inputs as of the bell's start.** Everything the clash of bell b reads
//! is its value at the start of b, whenever the clash is resolved: the
//! roster (`host::Presence`), the hosts' and garrisons' troops and stamina
//! (`host::Host::values_at`, `host::GarrisonState::at`), walls
//! (`holding::Holding::walls_at`) and relations ([`RelationsLog::at`]).
//!
//! **Bounds** (CL-01, CL-06, CL-14, I-27): [`resolve_clash`] refuses input
//! an honest program never builds (troops above `MAX_HOST_TROOPS`, stamina
//! above `STAMINA_CAP`, a doctrine multiplier outside
//! `[BPS_ONE, COMBAT_MAX_BPS]`, a retreat ratio above [`RETREAT_MAX_BPS`],
//! a faction above [`NEUTRAL`]), so the damage arithmetic cannot overflow
//! ([`MAX_DAMAGE_PRODUCT_BPS`]); honest outcomes are unchanged.
//!
//! **Quiet bells.** A bell with no arrivals in which resolving would change
//! nothing ([`is_quiet`]: no hostile combatants share a hex and no hex is
//! over its fair share) needs no resolution: skipping it gives the same
//! state, and sieges count a run of quiet bells in closed form
//! (`siege::Siege::advance_quiet`). Hostile residents sharing a hex (for
//! example besiegers and a garrison that still has troops) fight every
//! bell, so such a bell is never quiet.
//!
//! **Two bodies, one rule set** (I-14): [`resolve_clash`] is the M1 lab's
//! Phase A rewrite (tile buckets, per-hex damage arrays, an occupancy
//! table for the withdraw search), digest-identical to the step-by-step
//! reference [`resolve_clash_ref`], which host builds keep as the oracle
//! (`tests/frontier_clash_equiv.rs`).

// ------------------------------------------------------------ the Phase A body
//
// Same rules, same outcome digest as `resolve_clash_ref`: only the
// bookkeeping changes (M1 lab `m1/lab/clash-opt/phaseA.patch`).
// * units are bucketed by tile once (tiles do not change before step 5),
//   so no step scans every unit per tile;
// * dealt/taken per (tile, faction) are per-tile arrays, and the stamina
//   refund is decided when the tile's engagements are done;
// * the field step's withdraw search reads an occupancy table (host count
//   and faction mask per tile) updated as hosts withdraw, and a const
//   neighbour table, instead of re-scanning every unit per neighbour;
// * the field tie key `rand_id(cs, "field", f)` does not depend on the
//   tile, so it is hashed once per faction;
// * garrison results read a per-tile mask of staying hosts.
// Argument order of every `Relations::hostile` call is kept, so the result
// is identical even for an asymmetric `peaceful` matrix.
