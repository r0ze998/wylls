//! Faction doctrines (design §4.1, D17; owner decision O5, 2026-09-27).
//!
//! Each of the six factions has one **doctrine**: a tech bias, a unit
//! variant and a civic power. Doctrines are asymmetric, but **no doctrine
//! multiplies a scored fact** (O5). The faction index (§5.6) scores:
//!
//! | Path | Scored facts |
//! |---|---|
//! | Dominion | March-control bells, captures |
//! | Prosperity | production |
//! | Knowledge | techs researched, science pledged |
//! | Concord | Engine contribution, treaty-days kept |
//!
//! Per-capita indices of large factions vary by only ~1.4% between seasons
//! [sim], so any multiplier on one of these facts (the draft table's +10%
//! food, +10% ore, +20% science, ×1.2 Knowledge weight, cheaper settlers,
//! doubled Frontier Grant) wins almost every season: Lumen won 99.5% of 600
//! simulated seasons with the draft table [sim, M0 §E1]. So [`Doctrine`]
//! has **no field** that scales production, science, a path weight, Engine
//! pledges, settler cost or grants. A doctrine changes only how facts are
//! earned: combat (a drilled stance, the arrival bell), time (marches,
//! caravans, the war horn), costs that are not facts (walls, troop upkeep),
//! logistics (supply) and siege rules.
//!
//! The magnitudes are tuned in the host simulator (`frontier-sim
//! doctrines`) so that every doctrine wins 16.7% ± 2 points of seasons,
//! and a reduced harness gates the table in CI (`frontier-sim` test
//! `doctrine_balance_gate`). Parts marked *not simulated* have no
//! mechanism in the simulator yet (Bourse, caravans, Waystones, research
//! tree, War, heartland sieges); they are kept small and must be re-checked
//! when their mechanism lands.
