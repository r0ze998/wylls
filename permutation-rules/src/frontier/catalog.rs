//! The M1 build, train and starter catalog (contract §7, I-41, I-56).
//!
//! **Normative source: `frontier-sim/src/model.rs`** and the `sim.rs`
//! rules the contract names (build l. 1480–1505, walls l. 1508–1530,
//! train l. 1535–1560 and the variant surcharge l. 1790–1800). Every
//! table here is copied field for field; `frontier-sim/tests/
//! catalog_equality.rs` (W1-D) proves the copy equal. The tables are part
//! of the ruleset hash ([`super::ruleset_hash`]).
//!
//! Amounts in the tables are whole units, as in `model.rs`; the functions
//! return [`Cost`] in milli-units (`Holding::pay` takes milli), and
//! production in milli-units per hour (`Effect::Production`).
//!
//! **Doctrine multipliers.** The simulator's draft doctrines scale food,
//! ore and science production; the kernel doctrine table (rules v10, O5)
//! has no such field, so every multiplier here is neutral and only
//! `Doctrine::wall_cost` applies (walls).
//!
//! **Training is immediate** (sim; I-56): [`train`] returns a cost, no
//! duration, and there is no `Effect::Troops`.
//!
//! **Conquest rules (MC, K2):** [`train_v2`] prices training under the v2
//! rules from [`TRAIN_PROD_COST_V2`] (the Horseman line without its
//! variant surcharge); [`CATALOG_VERSION_V2`] and [`write_tables_v2`] bind
//! it into `ruleset_hash_input_v2`. Every M1 table and [`train`] are
