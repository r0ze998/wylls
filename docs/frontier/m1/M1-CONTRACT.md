# M1 "First Bell": the integration contract

**Version v1.13** (2026-09-30, integ-W6t review response; sections changed: §8.4, §13.4, §15; **§29 lists each change**). **v1.12** (2026-09-30, the `w6-s7` triage amendments of the wave-6 fix units U1–U5; sections changed: §3.2, §5.5, §5.11, §6, §8.2, §8.3, §8.5, §8.6, §10.2, §12, §13.4, §13.5, §15; **§28 lists each change**; integ-W6t filled U1's values and added the V7/T17 row and O-M1-28/29). **v1.11** (2026-09-29, integ-W6r amendments in the wave-6 review response; sections changed: §8.2, §12, §13.6, I-47; **§27 lists each change**). **v1.10** (2026-09-29, integ-W6 amendments in the wave-6 integration window, pass 1; sections changed: §3.2, §5.5, §5.8, §5.11, §8.2, §8.5, §8.6, §12, §13.4; **§26 lists each change**). **v1.9** (2026-09-28, integ-W5 review response; sections changed: §5.2, §5.5, §5.7, §8.5, §8.7, §9.5, §10.2, §12, §13.1, §13.3, §13.4; **§25 lists each change**). **v1.8** (2026-09-28, integ-W5 amendments in the wave-5 integration window; sections changed: §5.2, §5.3, §5.4, §5.5, §5.7, §5.11, §8.2, §8.4, §8.5, §8.6, §9.5, §10.2, §12, §13.1, §13.3, I-14; **§24 lists each change**). **v1.7** (2026-09-28, integ-W4 review response; sections changed: §5.3, §5.5, §5.10, §5.11, §6, §8.2, §8.4, §8.6, §9.5, §12; **§23 lists each change**). **v1.6** (2026-09-28, integ-W4 amendments in the wave-4 integration window; sections changed: §5.3, §5.5, §5.9, §5.10, §5.11, §6, §8.2, §8.4, §9.5, §10.2, §12; **§22 lists each change**). **v1.5** (2026-09-28, integ-W3 amendments after the wave-3 review; sections changed: §5.3, §5.4, §5.5, §5.9, §5.10, §5.11, §6, §8.1, §8.2, §8.4, §8.6, §9.4; **§21 lists each change**). **v1.4** (2026-09-28, integ-W3 amendment in the wave-3 integration window; section changed: §5.5; **§20 lists the change**). **v1.3** (2026-09-28, integ-W2 amendments after the wave-2 review; sections changed: §4.1, §4.2, §5.2, §5.3, §5.5, §5.7, §5.8, §5.11, §8.2, §8.3, §8.7, §9.1, §9.4, §12, §13.1; **§19 lists each change**). **v1.2** (2026-09-27, integ-W1 amendments after the wave-1 review; sections changed: §3.2, §4.1, §4.2, §5.3, §5.4, §5.5, §5.6, §5.9, §5.10, §5.12, §6, §7, §8.7, §12; **§18 lists each change**). **v1.1** (2026-09-27, review revision of v1.0). v1.1 answers a review of 21 issues (5 marked blocker, 16 major; three duplicate others and are merged, so 18 distinct findings). **§17 gives each issue's verdict with its evidence and the sections it changed.** Where v1.1 and v1.0 differ, v1.1 wins; the first issue is kept as `lab/contract-rev/M1-CONTRACT.v1.0.md`.

- **Date:** 2026-09-27. **Role:** M1 integration architect. **Status:** normative for every M1 implementer from the moment the owner accepts it (owner decisions still open are listed in §15 and in `DECISIONS.md`; each has a working default that implementers build to).
- **Base:** branch `codex/frontier` at `d95fa25` (worktree `.claude/worktrees/frontier-integ`, clean). Planning phase: nothing in the repo was changed, no commit, no push, no server, no chain transaction.
- **Merged from:** the four area designs in `scratchpad/frontier/m1/design/` — `program.md` (the on-chain program), `offchain.md` (keeper, relay, herald, bots, verifier, local stack), `web.md` (browser client), `closeout.md` (the M0 remainder, CL-01…CL-38). **Normative above them:** DESIGN rev 3.1 §0–§13 and §19, `M0-FINAL.md`, the owner decisions O1–O8, N1–N5, D23. Where this contract and an area design differ, **this contract wins**; §2 lists every conflict and how it was resolved.
- **Evidence it relies on:** SP-V2 and SP-FEE (M0b), the M1 lab runs `m1/lab/clash-opt` (Phase A clash rewrite: worst ResolveFromInputs 540,891 → 274,798 CU, heap 25,832 → 21,024 B, digest-identical on 4,320 inputs [measured]), `m1/lab/offchain-svmspeed` (LiteSVM ≈ 60–90M CU/s on this machine [measured]), `m1/lab/rev31-m1` (capacity with M1 budgets [model]), `m1/lab/closeout-civ` (the legacy CI failure reproduced [measured]).
- **Review checks for v1.1 (2026-09-27, read-only) [measured]:** SP-V2 `spv2.so` is 480,512 B (`out/plain-v2`) and 540,608 B (`program-kprobe`, sbpfv2 release) against SP-FEE's 13,600-B `sfee_probe.so`; `permutation-rules/src/frontier/clash.rs` step 2a (l. 652) seeds its caps from the non-arrival units of the input only; `m0b/spikes/SP-V2/beacons/quicknet` holds 32 rounds; `rustup target list --installed --toolchain 1.95.0` lists only `aarch64-apple-darwin`; `lsof` shows the owner's services on 127.0.0.1:4185, 4191 and 4194; `solana-test-validator 3.1.9` is installed; `frontier-sim` models one camp per province on a non-site tile (`sim.rs` l. 87–103, 1119–1147) and trains troops instantly (l. 1535–1560).
- **Tags:** [measured], [sim], [model], [estimate], [design] as in DESIGN. **MUST / MUST NOT** are binding on implementers; "should" is advice.

## 0. The contract in one page

1. **What M1 builds.** A new program `permutation-frontier` (new program id, SBPF v2, no money, no MagicBlock) with 50 instructions (49 plus the test-only `oracle` ResolveClash) over **17 account kinds** (v1.1 removes ProveBadSeal and SealVerdict: SettleTransit itself is the seal proof, and adds SweepPoolOwed); a shared no-Solana ABI crate `frontier-abi`; new pure kernels in `permutation-rules::frontier` (`beacon`, `addr`, `seal`, `fees`, `office`, `camp`, `explore`, `catalog`, the last three specified from `frontier-sim`) plus the M0 kernel bounds, the Phase-A clash rewrite and a storage-aware clash room; a Rust off-chain workspace `frontier-node` (keeper, herald, verifier v2, bots, LiteSVM-backed local chain node, drand replay server with a test-key mode, stack orchestrator, in-process integration tests); a Node relay under `permutation-gateway/src/frontier/` with a JS SDK; a static web client `permutation-server/web/frontier/` with a WASM build of the kernels and a browser tlock seal.
2. **What M1 does not build** (layouts reserve room): money, vaults, fees, stakes, claims, FactionShards, reward indices, banking (M2); postures, sieges, occupation, capture, holdings 2–3, pair tickets, governance, Mandates, decrees, relations, caravans, Bourse, Engine, Relic Sites, delegation, Shades (M2/M3).
3. **Key resolved choices** (§2): every program account except the Season PDA is a **with-seed address of the Season PDA** in SP-V2's exact grammar; **quiet-bell proof = ArrivalDay bitmap + SkipQuiet**; **SettleDeparture** moves departed-host values into the Holding and GatherClash reads Holdings; transit outcomes by **rank against the final arrival set**; **one-way reveal latch**; **minimum tip in priority terms**; **AnnounceSeason** re-roll guard; **Reveal takes the salt, not the seal key**; a **beneficiary** field on every keeper write; the **PS2 log contract** with per-entity event heads; keeper write classes **W (Reveal, to priority 2.0, pool-eligible)** and **D (delay-only, to 0.5, never pool-eligible)**; exit run on **ports 41000–41999**. **v1.1 adds:** a storage-aware clash room so a Province can never overflow its 56 entries (I-43); **settlement is the seal proof** and hosts in transit cannot act (I-44); loaded-data limits sized from the real program (I-45); tombstone-checked gathers and explicit status sets (I-46); ticket cohorts instead of a landing-time deadline (I-47); no global account written on the reveal, gather, resolve or settle paths; the remaining global writers are priced in the §8.8 lock table (I-48); rent refunds go back to the payer that paid (I-49); CU and heap escape hatches (I-50); a program-level join gate and upgrade-authority AnnounceSeason for the playtest (I-51); a claim grace for defence refunds (I-52); a `test-beacon` build so day-scale gates do not wait for downloads (I-53); real 400-ms slots in Mode A (I-54); the integrator owns manifests and locks (I-55); kernels specified from the simulator (I-56); a 7-wave plan (I-57); verifier checks V11–V13 and tampers T17–T22 (I-58).
4. **Delivery:** 7 waves, ≤ 6 units each, exclusive file ownership per wave, and an integrator who owns manifests, lockfiles and a two-day integration window after each merge (§11); a gate per wave with exact commands (§12); the exit test plan (§13). **Honest estimate (§14): 12 calendar weeks nominal, ≈ 50% by 12.5 weeks and ≈ 80% by 14.5, with six parallel implementers plus an integrator; ≈ 58.5 unit engineer-weeks + ≈ 4 integrator = ≈ 62.5 engineer-weeks.** v1.0's "10 weeks, ≈ 45 (§0) / 47 (§14) engineer-weeks" is withdrawn: the two figures disagreed and left out integration, gate wall time and owner-approval latency. The M0 closeout (N5) completes at week 1.5, not in week 1.

## 1. Scope and non-goals

**In (M1 program):** Season lifecycle (announce, create, genesis seed, run, end, close, abort before joins), rings and provinces (OpenRing, ring seeds, OpenProvince with barbarian camps), FoldOccupancy, Join (free; invite-gated through `Season.join_gate` in the playtest preset, I-51), session keys, vigil, site tickets with displacement and a challenge window, Harvest/Build/Train, Muster/Dissolve/Garrison, Explore/SettleExplore, dormancy release and stranded hosts, Depart with the mandatory seal and a minimum tip, Reveal (quota ranking, displacement, ArrivalDay, latch), SettleDeparture, GatherClash, ResolveFromInputs, SkipQuiet, SettleTransit (which opens and judges the seal: the bad-seal proof, I-44), SweepPoolOwed, beacons (PostAnchor single and combined, PostSeed, PostBeacon), ArchiveAnchors and every close path, DefencePool with ClaimDefence (Reveal-only eligibility, claim grace I-52), event chains and logs. ResolveClash (single transaction) exists **only** under the `oracle` feature, for tests.

**In (off-chain and web):** keeper (beacons, genesis, rings, folds, tickets, reveals with escalation from ≥ 150 rotating payers, departure settlement, gathers, resolves, quiet skips, transit settlement, archives, closes, defence claims), herald fold and cached read path, relay (free, sponsored), bots (1,000, with 8 adversarial personas), verifier v2 (entity chains, randomness audit, seal audit with the stock `tlock` crate, clash replay, land, explore and payment checks, 22 tamper classes), local stack (Mode A accelerated), web client (map, holding panel, march UI, tracker, bell sheet, clash report with in-browser verification, onboarding, practice mode, spectator), JA/EN.

**Out of M1 even though DESIGN §12 lists it:** PosturePDAs / CommitPosture / RevealPosture (M3; DESIGN §12 lists them under M1 accounts — deviation I-16, owner to confirm). Pair tickets (M3). The ER lane, Skirmish, Arena (O8).

**Exit (DESIGN §12 + task):** every instruction under budget on SBF (SBPF v2) with adversarial fill; a pre-funding test for every creation path and a forgery test for every keyed account; program-level lag and "no Reveal after close" property tests; a 7-day accelerated local season with 1,000 bots on ports in 41000–41999; verifier PASS on the real season and FAIL on every tamper class (22); web smoke tests; the full Reveal CU measured and fed to the C4 model; a cheaper quiet-bell proof in place; the clash kernel optimised with heap margin kept. **Then, only with the owner's approval,** a private devnet playtest of 50–200 people with no money.

## 2. Conflict register (resolved)

"Owner?" = yes means the resolution changes something the owner decided or DESIGN rev 3.1 states, so it is also an owner decision in §15 (the resolution is the working default until the owner rules).

| # | Topic | Sources in conflict | Resolution (normative) | Owner? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I-01 | Player account addresses | DESIGN §8.2 (PDAs with stored bump for Citizen/Holding/Province); program D2 (with-seed) | **With-seed of the Season PDA for every program account except the Season.** No bump anywhere except the Season's, found once in AnnounceSeason and stored | yes (D2) |
| I-02 | Seed grammar | closeout CL-21 ("big-endian", `ar` = 30 B with i32); program §3.1 (little-endian, i16 coordinates, `day u16`); SP-V2 `acct.rs` (LE, i32, `day u32`) | **SP-V2's grammar byte for byte:** `tag(2) ‖ lowercase hex of the fixed-width little-endian key fields`, coordinates as **i32**, days as **u32**, at most 15 raw bytes (≤ 32 B). Accounts *store* P, Q as i16; seeds widen them to i32. §4.1 | no |
| I-03 | ABI home | program: layouts in the program crate without the `program` feature; offchain P1: a no-Solana `frontier-abi` crate | **`frontier-abi`** (root workspace member, `no_std`, depends only on `permutation-rules`): layouts, tags, data encodings, errors, log kinds, event-head function, budgets table, JSON vector writer. The program, svm-tests, `frontier-node` and the JS vectors all consume it | no |
| I-04 | Who gets rent refunds and tips on keeper writes | program: `rent_payer = revealer` (the fee payer); offchain P4: a beneficiary in the data | **v1.1 (I-49): the fee payer pays the rent and gets it back** (`rent_to` = the fee payer), so a keeper's payer pool replenishes itself as accounts close; **tips, march fees and rewards go to `beneficiary [32]`** in the data of Reveal, GatherClash, ResolveFromInputs and SettleTransit. PostAnchor, PostAnchorMulti and PostSeed carry `beneficiary` for the liveness log only (anchors and caches pay no reward) | no |
| I-05 | Relay funding of player actions | offchain P5 (separate rent_payer/funder signer); program prologue (`payer (s,w)`, may equal actor) | The player prologue's **`payer` signer is the funder** of rent and escrow; the relay uses its pool key as both fee payer and `payer`. **v1.1 (I-47):** the Holding's rent is escrowed in the Citizen at FileTicket by the ticket's funder and moved into the Holding by SettleTicket, so `Holding.rent_payer` is the player's funder even when a keeper settles the ticket. **Escrow refunds (bond, bounced tip) go to `Holding.rent_payer`** (M2 adds a per-transit funder) | no |
| I-06 | Reveal data: seal key `k` or salt | program: `k [16]`; web: marchbook never stores `k`, sends the salt | **Reveal and SettleTransit take `salt [32]`** (program §10 cut (b)): `commit = sha256("PS-FRONTIER-MARCH-v1" ‖ plain37 ‖ salt)`; saves one sha256; the browser never stores `k` or `sigma` | no |
| I-07 | "No Reveal after gather" | closeout CL-23 (latch via read-only ClashInputs absence); program Reveal (no such key) | Reveal takes the canonical ClashInputs key read-only and refuses if it is not absent (`LatchClosed`), and also refuses if the destination Province has `resolved_next > arrive` (defence in depth; the destination is Reveal's last path province anyway) | no |
| I-08 | Tip floor | program `tip_min` 10,006 lamports; closeout CL-22 (priority terms, from the measured Reveal); web (zero tip allowed with confirmation) | **Minimum tip in priority terms**: `tip_min = fees::min_tip_lamports(season.min_reveal_priority_milli, season.reveal_cu_limit, season.reveal_loaded_limit)` = `ceil(p × (limit + 1,320 + 8·⌈L/32,768⌉)) + 2,500` lamports; defaults p = 0.433, limit 26,000 until the wave-3 measurement, **L = 1 MiB until the release `.so` is measured (I-45) → 14,441 lamports** (v1.0: 14,337 with a 64-KiB L). **Zero tip is impossible**; Depart refuses `TipTooLow`; the web drops the zero-tip option | yes (D8 wording "optional tip") |
| I-09 | Genesis re-roll guard | closeout CL-24 (AnnounceSeason ≥ 24 h before, single-use id, bond); program (none) | **AnnounceSeason (0x08) is in M1**; genesis round fixed by the announcement; id single-use; creation bond (default 1 SOL, test SOL in M1) burned on a pre-join abort after the genesis round is public | yes |
| I-10 | Quiet-bell proof | DESIGN §6.3 (open item); program D3 (ArrivalDay + SkipQuiet); offchain P9 (asks for one) | **ArrivalDay `ad‖(P,Q,day)` bitmap + `SkipQuiet(b0, n ≤ 24)`**. Idle day ≈ 6 transactions ≤ 60k CU each instead of 144 × 50–73k | yes (D3) |
| I-11 | Where a departed host's post-clash values live | DESIGN §6.2 (origin Province entry until SettleTransit; GatherClash reads origin Provinces); program D4 (SettleDeparture copies into the Holding; gathers read Holdings) | **Program D4.** Keeper dependency becomes: resolve(origin, depart_bell) → SettleDeparture → gather(dest) | yes (D4) |
| I-12 | Quota-refused and displaced arrivals | offchain P7 (must not be routed); program D5 (rank against the final arrival set in ClashInputs) | **Program D5**: at SettleTransit an arrival not in the final set is compared by `(dep_mass, slot_key)` against the faction's recorded final set: outranked, or its citizen already has a higher-ranked arrival there → **bounce, no loss**; otherwise → routed. No extra write at Reveal. Keepers MUST settle refused arrivals before `CloseClashInputs` (grace 1,008 bells) | yes (D5) |
| I-13 | ResolveFromInputs write set | DESIGN §8.6 rule 2 (exactly one account); program D6 (Province + ClashInputs fate table) | **Program D6**: writes Province and the same province-bell's ClashInputs (delay-only, same stream) | yes (D6) |
| I-14 | Clash kernel optimisation | program D7 (Phase A now; Phase B before exit if gates re-pass); closeout CL-29 (1,200-fill search on RFI) | **Phase A lands in wave 1** (digest-identical, equivalence test promoted). **Phase B is decided at the wave-5 gate** only if the doctrine proxy gate, the nightly 1,500-season band and golden digests re-pass on the new variance stream; otherwise Phase A only | yes (rules change) |
| I-15 | Budgets | DESIGN 650k per clash / 541k RFI; program 460k / 340k; offchain keeper "RFI up to 650k with heap frame" | **ResolveFromInputs 340k (290k with Phase B), worst-case clash 460k (≤ 3 gathers × 40k + 340k), Reveal 26k, SettleTransit 85k.** v1.1 (I-50): **budgets are gates, not liveness limits**. Every gated fill keeps heap ≤ 28 KiB and CU ≤ budget, and the keeper's CU limit is the budgets table (measured max + 5%); a write that still exceeds it is retried up to 1.4M CU and with a 256-KiB heap frame, so a fill worse than the worst found costs money, never a frozen province | no |
| I-16 | Postures in M1 | DESIGN §12 (PosturePDAs in M1 accounts); program D9 (no postures); web (composer behind a flag); offchain (RevealPosture duties, CommitPosture bots) | **No postures in M1.** Every resident fights at Hold; ClashInputs reserves the posture area; `po` seed tag and tags 0x90/0x91 reserved; keeper, bots and web ship no posture code paths (web composer not built) | yes |
| I-17 | Land features | web (pair tickets); offchain bots (pair tickets) | **No pair tickets, no holdings 2–3, no sieges, captures, occupation, diplomacy** in M1 (program D10) | no |
| I-18 | Round rounding | DESIGN §8.5 `round_at` (rounds down); kernel/lab (round up) | **"The first quicknet round scheduled at or after x"** everywhere: `T(b) = first_round_from(bell_end(b))`, `S(b,r) = first_round_from(A + W + Δ)`, ring and genesis seeds `first_round_from(t + 600 + Δ)`; kernel `frontier::beacon` (CL-19/20) | no (M0 close item) |
| I-19 | Ticket challenge window | DESIGN §2.2 ("end of bell b + 1"); program D12; web ("until end of b + 1") | **Superseded by I-47 (v1.1).** A provisional holding becomes final at `round_time(S(b_ticket, r_site)) + 600` **and** only once its province's ticket cohort for `b_ticket` is closed (every ticket filed there at `b_ticket` settled, or 24 bells passed). Displacement has no time condition inside the cohort. Web copy states this | yes (D12, text) |
| I-20 | Payments to drained accounts | — (gap) | **`pay_or_divert`** (program D13): a payment that would leave a non-program recipient below rent exemption goes to the DefencePool, logged `DIVERT` | no |
| I-21 | Keeper classes and pool eligibility | program §3.5 (evidence + eligibility on Reveal, PostAnchor*, PostSeed, Gather, Resolve); closeout CL-30/31a (only window-closing writes eligible); offchain F7 (the split) | **Class W = Reveal** (RevealPosture in M3): escalate ×2/slot to **P_def 2.0**, pool-eligible. **Class D = PostAnchor*, PostSeed, ConsumeGenesisSeed, GatherClash, ResolveFromInputs, SkipQuiet, SettleDeparture, SettleTransit, ArchiveAnchors, and (v1.1, I-47/I-48/I-52) SettleTicket, OpenRing, ConsumeRingSeed, OpenProvince, FoldOccupancy, ClaimDefence**: escalate to **P_delay 0.5** from the keeper's own budget, never pool-eligible. **Class N** = the rest at a fixed low bid (closes, sweeps, beacon logs, explore and dormancy settlement). ProveBadSeal no longer exists (I-44). Evidence fields are still recorded on anchors and ClashInputs (liveness report); ClaimDefence accepts only ArrivalSlot evidence | yes (D18 re-size) |
| I-22 | ClaimDefence timing | DESIGN §12 (pool in M2); program §6.7 (in M1); offchain Q4 | **ClaimDefence built in M1 (wave 4), Reveal-only eligibility, test SOL.** v1.1 (I-52): SettleTransit keeps a claim-eligible slot until it is claimed or a 6-bell claim grace passes. First item on the cut list if wave 4 slips (then M2) | yes |
| I-23 | Keeper start bid | DESIGN §6.4 ("start at the tip level"); offchain Q3 (zero margin) | Default **p_start = p_tip** (as designed); flag `--peace-start <fraction>` exists, default off | yes |
| I-24 | Owner self-reveal path | web §5 (unsigned Reveal tx through `/gw/f/relay`); offchain F8/§7.3 (`/f/reveal` → keeper loopback) | **The browser sends reveal material, not a transaction:** `POST /gw/f/reveal {holding, transit_slot, plain, salt, ct_hash}` → relay → keeper `POST /v1/reveal`, which builds, signs with a random pool payer and escalates. `/f/relay` refuses any Reveal shape (`UseRevealRoute`) | no |
| I-25 | The "7-day local season" environment | program §14 (real-time Agave ≥ 4 validator); offchain F5/F6 (Mode A LiteSVM-backed node at 20×, drand-replay; Mode R optional) | **Mode A is the exit run** (release `.so`, real historical quicknet rounds, scaled Clock, 20×: 7 game days in 8.4 h). **v1.1 (I-54): slots stay 400 ms of real time at every scale**; the Clock advances 8 game seconds per slot at 20×. **Mode R** (24 h real time on a validator) is a complement if the owner approves | yes |
| I-26 | Ports | offchain 38810–38930; task: 41000–41999 | **All M1 services and runs use 41000–41999** (§10.3). Tests bind `127.0.0.1:0`. **v1.1:** gates check only the ports M1 binds; they never require the reserved ports to be idle (the owner's own services listen on 4185, 4191 and 4194 [measured 2026-09-27]) | no |
| I-27 | "Never retreat" encoding | DESIGN plaintext `retreat_bps u16`; kernel `Option<Bps>`; closeout CL-01 cap `BPS_ONE × 10` (does not fit u16) | **`retreat_bps = 0` means never retreat; `1..=60,000` is the ratio in bps; above 60,000 is an invalid plaintext.** Kernel `clash::RETREAT_MAX_BPS = 60,000`, **defined in `clash.rs` (W1-A) and re-exported by `seal` (v1.1)**; `clash::validate` refuses above it | no (pins a gap) |
| I-28 | Invalid plaintext inside a valid seal | — (gap) | `frontier::seal::Plain::validate` (version 1, reserved bytes zero, `path_len ≤ 32`, unused path bits zero, **every step a hex direction (< 6), `dest_tile < 61`** (v1.2), stance ∈ {Hold, Assault, Flank, Brace}, retreat ≤ 60,000, host and arrive match the transit; `seal-vectors-v1.json` has a case for every refusal and fclient re-exports the kernel's validate). Reveal refuses `BadPlaintext`; **SettleTransit judges it a bad seal (code 5, I-44)**, so it destroys the host. The browser self-audit runs the same validate | no |
| I-29 | Provisional holdings and hosts | program (Holding rewritten in place on displacement; nothing forbids marching while provisional) → a displaced Holding would orphan transit records and freeze gathers (A1) | **Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Explore and Depart require `holding.state == final`** (`NotFinal`); Harvest/Build/Train are allowed while provisional (lost on displacement). The flip provisional → final is lazy in the prologue of any owner action or SettleTicket once `now ≥ ticket_final_ts` | no |
| I-30 | Genesis rings | program (RingSeeds 0..g "derivable"; no creator named); DESIGN §3.1 (ring 0 Concord neutral, ring 1 Six Seats) | `OpenRing(d ≤ g)` is allowed once the Season is Seeded and creates RingSeed(d) with `seed = sha256("PSF-RING" ‖ genesis_seed ‖ le16(d))`, status seeded (no ConsumeRingSeed). **Rings 0–1 are opened with their sites `reserved`** (no tickets, no camps); tickets start at ring 2 | no |
| I-31 | Holding size | DESIGN 832 B; program 1,280 B | **1,280 B** (four 96-B transit records, full Accruals; v1.1 takes `pool_owed u64` from its reserve). With the 384-B Citizen of v1.1 (I-47) per-player rent is **9,753,600 lamports ≈ 0.0098 SOL** (+24% over DESIGN) | no (noted) |
| I-32 | Depart stamina | kernel (march stamina by path); program (path sealed → charge the maximum `march_stamina(32)`) | **Charge the maximum at Depart** (leaks nothing; simple); the composer shows it | yes |
| I-33 | Onboarding timeline | DESIGN §2.3 ("minute 10+" first report); web §6.3 (first holding 11–21 min, first report 31–41 min) | The web and the DESIGN text state the reachable times; no rule change (W protects C4) | yes (text) |
| I-34 | Doctrine display name | faction "Ember" (id 4) vs doctrine C "Ember" | Working default: doctrine C is displayed as **"Flame"** in M1 UI strings; kernel identifiers unchanged | yes |
| I-35 | Fog | web Q9 | Presentation-only fog **with** a "show everything" switch (every account is public) | yes (low) |
| I-36 | Bot profiles | offchain Q8 | **Copy** `Arch`/`Profile` into `frontier-agents` with a field-for-field equality test; `frontier-sim` is not changed for this (its digests stay stable) | no |
| I-37 | Workspace | program (root member); root lock already carries `solana-program 4.0.0` | `permutation-frontier` and `frontier-abi` join the root workspace; if `cargo metadata --locked` cannot resolve the arkworks 0.5 set together with `permutation-chain`, the program moves to its own workspace (like `svm-tests`) with its own lock, and `build-frontier.sh` handles both (decided by the wave-1 unit, recorded in DECISIONS) | no |
| I-38 | Log format | program (`"PSF1"` record, key fields, new heads); offchain P2 (`"PS2"`, entity 32 B, seq u32); DESIGN §8.3 ("PS2 event", seal in the Depart log) | **§6**: `sol_log_data(["PS2", body])`; body = ver, kind, bell, kind-specific key and payload, then a chain tail `{entity kind, seq u64, head}` per chained entity; `head = sha256(prev_head ‖ le64(seq) ‖ body_without_tail)`. DEPART carries the commitment and the 165-B seal (DESIGN wins) | no |
| I-39 | Error codes the keeper needs | offchain P8 (`SlotChanged`, `WindowClosed`, `NotAnchored`, `SeedNotReady`, `NotAllGathered`, `AlreadyDone`) | Mapped onto the program table plus new codes 51–61 (§5.4): 35 SlotMoved, 12 WindowClosed, 8 NoAnchor, 54 SeedNotReady, 39 NotGathered, 52 AlreadyDone | no |
| I-40 | Join session registration | program (`[session s?]` optional signer); web (session pubkey in Join data) | **Session pubkey in Join's data; no session signature** (the wallet's signature authorises it) | no |
| I-41 | Explore / camps / catalog kernels | program §11 lists them as new rules work, no owner | New modules `frontier::{camp, explore, catalog}` in wave 1 (rules-shared unit). **v1.1: specified from the simulator (I-56); `holding::Effect::Troops` is dropped because training is immediate** | no |
| I-42 | Mutation count in the Phase A report | program.md "5 of 7 caught"; clash-opt README "4 of 5" | Recorded as a discrepancy; the promoted rules test MUST add the untested refund `d > 0` corner and re-run the mutation set; the number in the wave-1 gate report is the one that counts | no |
| I-43 | Province entry storage at ResolveFromInputs (review blocker) | kernel step 2a counts only residents; Muster caps states 1–2 at 48; departed entries (state 3) wait for SettleDeparture | **Storage-aware room.** The program passes the kernel `Occupancy {pending[f] = entries in state 2 of faction f, storage_free = 56 − entries in states 1–3}`; step 2a seeds its per-faction and total counts with the pending musters and admits an arrival only while `total < 48`, `per_faction < 8` and `admitted < storage_free`; the rest **bounce with no loss** in kernel rank order. So `entries after = R + M + D + admitted ≤ 56` always, and a faction never exceeds 8 residents when its musters join. With no pending or departed entries the outcome is bit-identical to v1.0 | yes (outcome change when entries are pending or departed; doctrine proxy gate re-run) |
| I-44 | Bad seals and hosts in transit (review blocker) | DESIGN §6.2 (ProveBadSeal + SealVerdict; SettleTransit after close + 1 bell); v1.0 (ProveBadSeal class N; no action block while a transit is unsettled) | **Settlement is the proof.** SettleTransit takes the logged `commit` and `seal`, checks them against `seal_root`, reads the round-T(arrive) signature from THE anchor or, once archived, from the archive entry (which now stores it), opens the seal with the FO check and judges it (codes 1–5). Settlement cannot skip the proof, the race with a held proof disappears, and a late settlement (after archive) still judges. **ProveBadSeal and SealVerdict are removed** (tag 0x53, seed tag `sv`, magic `PSF1SVRD` and error 14 reserved). **Depart, Dissolve and Explore refuse a host that appears in any transit record of its Holding in state 1–3** (`HostInTransit`); the bad-seal branch removes a destination resident through a `Forfeit` pending op (troops lost at the settle of the current bell; past clashes unchanged) and never returns a routed host | yes (DESIGN §6.2 names ProveBadSeal) |
| I-45 | Loaded-data limit (review blocker) | v1.0 / SP-FEE: `SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(65,536)` everywhere, measured with a 13,600-B probe program | **Per-kind limit `L(kind) = round_up(programdata_len + 45 + Σ(account data + 64), 32 KiB)`** at the kind's worst account set (SIMD-0186 counts the LoaderV3 programdata), generated into `budgets.rs` from the release `.so` deployed with `--max-len = round_up(1.25 × .so, 4 KiB)`; `Season.reveal_loaded_limit` feeds `tip_min`; working default 1 MiB (+256 cost units instead of +16). Checked by `g01_loaded_limit_*` against the release `.so` in a harness that enforces SIMD-0186 accounting (control test), and once on the installed `solana-test-validator 3.1.9` | no |
| I-46 | Lifecycle gates (review major) | v1.0 GatherClash checks the window and absence only; OpenRing `status ≥ Seeded`; OpenProvince no status | **GatherClash refuses `bell < province.resolved_next`** (`LatchClosed`: the tombstone rule of §4.2 holds for inputs); **SettleTransit uses ClashInputs only with flag 2 (resolved)**; OpenRing, ConsumeRingSeed and OpenProvince require effective status ∈ {Seeded, Running}. G2/G3 get a re-creation test for every closable kind | no |
| I-47 | Ticket finality (review major) | v1.0: displacement only before `final_ts = round_time(S) + 600`, SettleTicket class N | **Ticket cohorts.** FileTicket writes the ≤ 3 Provinces of its sites (they must exist) and counts the ticket in each province's cohort for `ticket_bell`; the SettleTicket that ends a ticket (fresh, displace, exhausted, expired) marks it settled in all of them. A holding becomes final only at `round_time(S) + 600` **and** once its cohort is closed (all settled, or `ticket_bell + 24` bells). Displacement inside the cohort has no time condition; a displaced ticket ends (the web offers a one-tap refile). SettleTicket is class D. To steal a site an attacker must now hold the Province against a D-class keeper for 24 bells (≈ $59k–163k on DESIGN §8.7's model) instead of 10 minutes against a fixed low bid (≈ 0.6 SOL) | yes (D12 text; onboarding unchanged when keepers settle promptly) |
| I-48 | Global accounts on hot paths (review major) | v1.0: `[dpool w]` in every SettleTransit; Frontier and one ProvinceFund written by N-class openings | **No W or D instruction writes the DefencePool except ClaimDefence, whose purpose is to debit it:** routed tips and fees and every divert in SettleTransit go to `Holding.pool_owed` and are swept by the N-class SweepPoolOwed (DESIGN §8.6 rule 2). **ProvinceFund is sharded per wedge** (`pf‖w`, 6 accounts) and carries its wedge's opening counters; OpenProvince and CloseProvince no longer write Frontier; FoldOccupancy folds the shards. OpenRing, ConsumeRingSeed, OpenProvince, FoldOccupancy and ClaimDefence are class D. Every remaining global writer is priced in the new lock table §8.8 | no |
| I-49 | Keeper payer economics (review major) | v1.0: payers pay rent, refunds go to the beneficiary; band [0.01, 0.05] SOL; one pool | **Rent refunds return to the fee payer that paid** (I-04 revised); **two pools** (reveal ≥ 150, delay ≥ 32); band floors computed from the c4 v3 p99 reveal count (default 0.215 SOL per reveal payer); **≥ 4 funders**, top-ups at rest; the keeper alerts below an effective N of 150 but never stops sending W writes; per-bell effective N is reported and gated in E5 | no |
| I-50 | CU and heap escape hatches (review major) | v1.0: no heap frame ever; CU limit never above the budget; SkipQuiet 60k assumed a cached quiet test; RFI 340k from a lighter write-back | **Allocator 256-KiB aware; keeper heap-frame retry; CU retry ladder to 1.4M**; kernel entries on chain use fixed-capacity arrays at the maxima; **SkipQuiet stops and commits below 40k CU remaining** and its budget is `60k + 30k per recomputed bell`; **RFI measured with the full M1 write-back on all 1,240 fills on SBF** (≈ 5–7 s at 60–90M CU/s), not the top 24 | no |
| I-51 | Abuse paths of a free M1 (review major) | v1.0: invites only at the relay; settle shapes charged to the named citizen; no tip or CU-price ceiling; XFF trusted | **`Season.join_gate`**: when set (playtest preset), Join needs the gate key's co-signature (`JoinGate`); the relay co-signs only with a valid invite. **AnnounceSeason requires the program's upgrade authority** (read from its ProgramData). Relay: settle shapes charged to the requester, nothing charged on a failed simulation, sponsored Depart tip ∈ {tip_min, ⌈1.5 tip_min⌉, 2 tip_min}, CU price 0, `X-Forwarded-For` trusted only from the herald's loopback peer | yes (playtest policy) |
| I-52 | Defence refund evidence lifetime (review major, two issues merged) | v1.0: SettleTransit closes the slot at close + 600; displacement overwrote evidence without a rule for `claimed` | **SettleTransit leaves a claim-eligible, unclaimed slot open** (flag `settled`) until it is claimed or `close + claim_grace` (6 bells) passes; CloseArrivalSlot closes it after that. **Displacement replaces `ev_*` and the beneficiary and resets `claimed = 0`**; the displaced reveal's evidence is not claimable (logged for the liveness report). ClaimDefence is class D | no (inside I-22) |
| I-53 | Day-scale gates without downloads (review blocker) | v1.0: W2–W4 gates need a game day of real rounds; 32 fixture rounds; wasm32 not installed; O-M1-12 unapproved; archive sized ≈ 20k rounds | **`test-beacon` build and `drand-replay --test-key`** (a deterministic local BLS key pinned by its own `QUICKNET_PK_HASH`, marker `PSF_TEST_BEACON_BUILD`, never deployable) for every in-process gate, nightly and rehearsal; real rounds only for W6's real-round runs and the exit. **O-M1-12 is a dated wave-1 ask** with a contiguous archive of ≈ 250k rounds (≈ 1.2 h fetch). Items that need an unapproved install are marked `PENDING-OWNER` in the gate report, not failed and not skipped silently | yes (O-M1-12) |
| I-54 | Mode A time model (review major) | v1.0: slot = 400 ms / scale (20 ms at 20×); latency criteria in game seconds; 24-h announce lead not in the wall time | **Real 400-ms slots at every scale**; the Clock advances `0.4 × scale` game seconds per slot; keeper escalation and contested detection stay per slot. E5 criterion 3 is stated in slots for the 20× run, and the game-second targets are checked in a scale-2 latency run (6 game hours, 3 h). The pre-season runs at scale 2,000 (the 24-h lead in ≈ 43 s) | no |
| I-55 | File ownership (review major) | v1.0: gaps in manifests, locks, the player prologue, the entry codec, svm-tests harness files, `web-lang`/`web-sdk` tests, app routing, G14 | **The integrator owns every Cargo.toml dependency section, every Cargo.lock, every package.json and package-lock.json, `rust-toolchain.toml` files and `.gitignore`s**; units request additions in their notes. The prologue and entry codec live in `frontier-abi` (W1-E). svm-tests area files are assigned per unit. `web-lang`/`web-sdk` tests, `app.mjs` and G14 have named owners. Each wave ends with a two-day integration window in which the integrator may fix any file | no |
| I-56 | Kernels from the simulator (review major) | v1.0: camp/explore/catalog specified by signature only; ≤ 2 camps on sites; Train queued | **`frontier-sim/src/model.rs` and the named `sim.rs` rules are normative** for `catalog`, `camp` and `explore`, with a field-equality test in `frontier-sim/tests/catalog_equality.rs`. **One camp per province on a passable non-site tile** (troops 100–400, daily respawn with chance ½ in provinces with a holding, evaluated at the province's first resolve or skip of a game day), plus an initial camp at OpenProvince for rings ≥ 2 (onboarding; a recorded deviation from the sim); camps no longer reduce `open_sites`. **Train is immediate** (sim). Explore gives `WORKS_EXPLORE` (4) always on the 3 floor explorations, otherwise with chance ½; **no goods in M1** (the sim has none; DESIGN §2.3's goods floor waits) | yes (camps, training time, floor goods) |
| I-57 | Plan and estimate (review majors) | v1.0: W1-E carried the ABI, the program core and the harness in 1.5 weeks; first integration at the W3/W4 gates; estimate 45 vs 47 ew | **7 waves** (§11): W1-E splits into abi (wave 1), program-core and svm-harness (wave 2); an integration unit in wave 4 owns the in-process tests; G14 moves to wave 5. **12 weeks nominal, ≈ 62.5 ew** (§14) | yes (schedule) |
| I-58 | Verifier coverage (review major) | v1.0: V1–V10, T1–T16; `BadSealUnproven` a warning | **V11 land** (ticket scores, cohort displacement rule, terrain and camps from ring seeds, genesis ring seeds), **V12 explore rolls**, **V13 payments** (rule-computed recipients and amounts FAIL; global lamport conservation informational); **`BadSealSurvived` FAIL**; tampers **T17–T22**. (Rebutted in part: SETTLE and EXPLORE_RESULT are already chained records carrying score and finds, so no new digest is needed; the checks were missing, not the data) | no |

### 3.2 Toolchains and builds

| Tree | Toolchain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| root workspace (rules, abi, program host tests, permutation-chain) | 1.89.0 (`rust-toolchain.toml`) | `cargo test --locked` |
| SBF build | `solana-cargo-build-sbf 3.1.9`, `--tools-version v1.52 --arch v2` | `export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"`; `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.95.0` only if `cargo metadata` meets an edition-2024 crate |
| `permutation-frontier/svm-tests`, `frontier-node`, `frontier-wasm` | 1.95.0 (own `rust-toolchain.toml`) | LiteSVM 0.16 does not build on 1.89 |
| `frontier-sim` | 1.89.0 | unchanged |
| program on the host | 1.89.0 | the program crate MUST build, clippy and test on the host with default features: the custom heap and the entrypoint are `cfg(target_os = "solana")`-gated; `--no-default-features` gives layouts and pure helpers only |
| gateway, web tests | node 20 | `npm test` in `permutation-gateway` |

`scripts/build-frontier.sh` (ported from `build-program.sh`) MUST: check the tool version; build `--arch v2`; refuse the artefact unless ELF `e_flags == 2`, the overflow-panic strings are present, and the marker strings `PSF_ORACLE_BUILD` and `PSF_TRACE_BUILD` are absent; print `file_sha256`, `program_hash`, `e_flags`; with `--twice`, build twice into two target dirs and fail unless the hashes match. Feature builds for tests: `--features trace` → `target/deploy-trace/`, `--features oracle` → `target/deploy-oracle/` (never deployable). The program embeds `RULESET_HASH` (v1.2: `permutation_rules::frontier::ruleset_hash()`: a version constant for **every** module of the frontier tree, the v9 combat tables, the catalog, the doctrine table, the stance damage table, `KERNEL_CONSTANTS` and the seal/camp/explore/office constants; published as the const `frontier_abi::presets::RULESET_HASH`, pinned to the kernel by a test and written to `presets.json`; an algorithm change that keeps every constant MUST bump its module's version) and `QUICKNET_PK_HASH`.

**Release build of record (v1.12, the `w6-s7` triage):** the release `.so` with the Depart arrival bound (§5.11 step 4) and the close limits (§10.2) is sha256 `d85e1bd74e29dc361925306839f4ea3bd10b709302e9e6cd9ee2b517aa3f2281` (875,824 B; test-beacon build `b2cef4a7502a14cdb002dac984668422ad7bddf740df69a025979ffc8ddda4e7`, 876,328 B), recorded by `scripts/build-frontier.sh --twice` in `W6T-1-NOTES.md` and pinned by `scripts/m1-run-s7.sh --expect-so-sha256` for the `w6-s7` re-run and the exit. It replaces `072b1205f92a16131d4c29753807de5720344e38a99ec24bb83e04a5409da98b` (875,768 B, the build `w6-s7` ran). **`RULESET_HASH` is unchanged** at `72c6b5835ded6418ed98b0c00b2ae45ce4c4b082d9614447dbce2c9d2e654bd9` (Phase B): the triage touches the program, not the kernel, and `occupancy_empty_keeps_the_phase_b_digests` and `m1_rules_keep_the_phase_b_digests` stay green.

### 3.3 Code rules

- **Program:** no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` outside tests; every arithmetic in the program crate is checked (overflow checks on in the release profile, explicit `checked_*` where a refusal code is wanted: `Overflow` 19); no borsh on hot paths (fixed-offset accessors from `frontier-abi`); every instruction validates its exact account count, owners, magics, signers and writability within its first ≈ 1.5k CU (DESIGN §8.6 rule 6); **never** `CreateAccount`/`CreateAccountWithSeed` (§4.2); **never** a caller-supplied bump; recompute every keyed address a reader trusts; arkworks field ops stay `#[inline(never)]`; no heap-frame request by default: the bump allocator accepts up to 256 KiB (it faults cleanly past the mapped region), every gated fill keeps heap ≤ 28 KiB, and kernel entries called on chain use fixed-capacity arrays at the maxima (48 hosts, 24 arrivals, 12 garrisons, 240 engagements) or a proved static bound (I-50).
- **Kernels (`permutation-rules::frontier`)**: pure, integer-only, `no_std`-compatible, no Solana types; a bound that only refuses invalid input MUST leave every honest outcome bit-identical (proved by the existing suite digests); a change that alters outcomes MUST re-run the doctrine proxy gate and the bot criterion and report the deltas against m0c.
- **Shared constants live once:** layouts/tags/errors/logs in `frontier-abi`; rules constants in `permutation-rules`; JS gets them only through generated files and vectors (`frontier-abi/vectors/*.json` → `permutation-gateway/client/src/frontier/` → `sync-web-sdk.mjs` → `web/sdk/frontier/`). Hand-copied constants are a review failure.
- **Style:** `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` on every Rust tree; JS in the repo's existing style (plain ESM, no build step, no new runtime deps in the web page except the vendored noble tree); docs in plain English with the confidence tags; Japanese UI text inline via `L`/`Lh`/`t`, English in the `en-frontier*.mjs` dictionaries.
- **New dependencies** MUST be pinned with `=`, listed in the unit's notes with a one-line reason and **requested from the integrator**, who applies them to the manifests and lockfiles (§3.4, I-55): expected set `litesvm =0.16.0`, `tokio`, `axum`, `rusqlite` (bundled), `blstrs`, `tlock =0.0.10`, `playwright-core`, `axe-core`, `@noble/curves 1.9.x`, `@noble/hashes 1.8.0` (vendored).
- **Never** edit `permutation-server/web/session.mjs`'s `sessionText`; the Frontier has its own text in `web/frontier/fsession.mjs`.
- v9 stays green: `permutation-chain`, `permutation-server`, the v9 web page and its tests MUST keep passing; changes to shared web files (`lang.mjs`, `map.mjs`) are **additive only**.

### 3.4 Git, commits and approvals

- Each unit works in its own worktree `.claude/worktrees/m1-<unit-id>` on branch `frontier/m1-<unit-id>` cut from the wave base. **Local commits on work branches are allowed. No push, ever, without a new owner approval** (the 2026-09-27 approval covered one push of `codex/frontier` only).
- Commit subject: `Frontier M1 <unit-id>: <what changed>`; body lists the CL/I/gate ids touched; trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- The integrator merges the wave's branches **in the order listed in §11** into a local `frontier/m1-integ`, runs the wave gate (§12), then fast-forwards local `codex/frontier`.
- **The integrator owns (I-55)** every `[dependencies]`/`[dev-dependencies]` section of every `Cargo.toml`, the root `Cargo.lock`, `frontier-node/Cargo.toml` and its `Cargo.lock`, `permutation-frontier/svm-tests/Cargo.lock`, `frontier-wasm/Cargo.lock`, every `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (`permutation-gateway`, `permutation-gateway/screens`), every `rust-toolchain.toml` and `.gitignore`. A unit may change them on its own branch to build; at merge the integrator re-applies the requested change on the integration branch (`cargo update -p <crate> --precise <v>` or a manifest edit followed by a build without `--locked`; `npm install --package-lock-only`) and commits it, then gates with `--locked` / `npm ci`.
- **Integration window:** after each wave's merge the integrator has up to two working days to make the gate green, and may change any file for that purpose (one commit per gate item, subject `Frontier M1 integ-W<n>: <gate item>`); ownership of the next wave starts after it. Its cost is in §14. A unit MUST NOT modify a file outside its ownership list; if it needs one, it asks the integrator, who either amends this contract (versioned, §16) or assigns the change to the owning unit.
- **No devnet or mainnet transaction** in M1 before the owner approves the playtest. Read-only public data downloads (historical quicknet rounds) and tool installs (wasm32 target, Agave ≥ 4.0, Playwright Chromium) wait for the owner decision in §15 (O-M1-12, asked on day 1 with dates). Until then every gate item that needs one is reported `PENDING-OWNER` (I-53). `solana-test-validator 3.1.9` is already installed; running it locally on 41080–41089 for the I-45 drill is not a devnet step.
- Unit reports go to `docs/frontier/m1/<unit-id>-NOTES.md` (if a hook refuses a file named `REPORT.md`, `-NOTES.md` is the rule anyway).

### 3.5 Tests every unit writes

- Kernel: unit tests next to the code, integration tests in `permutation-rules/tests/frontier_*.rs` (seeded xorshift, no proptest).
- Program: one LiteSVM test per (instruction, error code) (G13 coverage table, `svm-tests/src/cover/<area>.rs`, one file per area owner), test names prefixed by gate (`g01_…` … `g14_…`) so gates filter by prefix; host unit tests for pure helpers in the program crate.
- Off-chain: in-process tests over `ChainPort::InProcess` (LiteSVM + virtual time) first; binaries only add IO.
- JS: `node --test` files under `permutation-gateway/test/`; no network except `127.0.0.1:0` fixture servers.
- Every vector file is generated by exactly one producer and checked for freshness by exactly one test (`frontier-abi` writes, `web-frontier-codec.test.mjs` / `frontier-vectors.test.mjs` read).

`addr(kind, key) = create_with_seed(season_pda, seed, program_id) = sha256(season_pda ‖ seed ‖ program_id)`. `seed = tag(2 ASCII) ‖ lowercase-hex(raw)`, `raw` = the key fields little-endian, fixed width, ≤ 15 bytes. The Season is the only PDA: `["season", le64(id)]`, bump found once by AnnounceSeason and stored.

| Account | Tag | Raw key fields (LE) | Raw B | Seed B |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier | `fr` | — | 0 | 2 |
| RingSeed | `rs` | d u16 | 2 | 6 |
| ProvinceFund ×6 (v1.1: one per wedge, I-48) | `pf` | w u8 | 1 | 4 |
| JoinShard | `js` | faction u8, shard u8 | 2 | 6 |
| BeaconLog | `bl` | region u8 | 1 | 4 |
| DefencePool | `dp` | — | 0 | 2 |
| Citizen | `ct` | `sha256("PSF-CIT" ‖ wallet)[0..15]` | 15 | 32 |
| Holding | `ho` | P i32, Q i32, site u8 | 9 | 20 |
| Province | `pv` | P i32, Q i32 | 8 | 18 |
| ArrivalSlot | `ar` | P i32, Q i32, bell u32, faction u8, i u8 | 14 | 30 |
| ArrivalDay | `ad` | P i32, Q i32, day u32 | 12 | 26 |
| ClashInputs | `ci` | P i32, Q i32, bell u32 | 12 | 26 |
| *SealVerdict (removed in v1.1, I-44; tag reserved)* | `sv` | host_id u64, arrive_bell u32 | 12 | 26 |
| BellAnchor | `an` | bell u32, region u8 | 5 | 12 |
| SeedCache | `sd` | bell u32, region u8, nonce u8 | 6 | 14 |
| AnchorArchive | `aa` | region u8, part u32 (v1.3: `part = bell / 72`, a half day) | 5 | 12 |
| DefenceClaim | `dc` | `sha256("PSF-KPR" ‖ beneficiary)[0..8]`, day u32 | 12 | 26 |
| *PosturePDA (M3, reserved)* | `po` | P i32, Q i32, bell u32, pos u8 (v1.2: SP-V2's grammar) | 13 | 28 |

- **Presence** is authenticated by owner = program, magic, `season_id` and the stored key fields equal to the expected key; readers that need *the* instance (anchors, caches, slots, days, inputs, archives) also recompute the address (≈ 0.5k CU).
- **Absence** = the canonical address, owner = System, data length 0. **Lamports are ignored** (pre-funded = absent).
- `day(b) = b / 144`; `region_of(P,Q)` = kernel `geometry::region_of` (16 regions); `citizen_tag` = first 8 bytes of the Citizen address (little-endian u64), the quota's "citizen" id.
- **Host id (pinned):** `host_id = (province_index(P,Q) as u64) << 44 | (site as u64) << 40 | (gen as u64) << 32 | seq` (province index < 2^20 for R ≤ 128; site < 12; `gen` u8 bumped on every re-founding of the site; `seq` u32 from `Holding.host_seq`). The owner Holding's address is derivable from any host id; a `gen` that differs from the Holding's marks a stranded host.
- Vectors: `permutation-rules/vectors/addr-vectors-v1.json` (seed strings at the extremes; i32::MIN/MAX coordinates, u32::MAX bell, u64::MAX host) and `frontier-abi/vectors/addresses.json` (full addresses for a fixed season PDA and program id). They MUST match SP-V2 `acct.rs` byte for byte for `an`, `sd`, `ar`, `po`, `ci`, `sv`, `aa`.

### 4.2 Initialisation, closing and payments

- `init_with_seed(payer, target, seed, space)`: require absent; transfer `max(0, rent(space) − target.lamports)` from `payer` (System Transfer; payer signs); `AllocateWithSeed{base: season_pda, seed, space, owner: program}` signed by the Season PDA. The Season itself uses the PDA variant (`Allocate` + `Assign` with `invoke_signed`).
- `init_funded(fund, target, seed, space)`: as above, but the shortfall moves by direct lamport arithmetic from a **program-owned** fund (ProvinceFund for Provinces).
- `close_to(target, recipient)`: `resize(0)`, `assign(System)`, move all lamports with `pay_or_divert`. **v1.3:** `close_to` does not log; **every closing instruction emits `CLOSE` (§6) itself, before calling `close_to`**, carrying the final seq and head for chained accounts (W2-A's pinned split; the hand-over rule is in `permutation-frontier/src/proc/mod.rs`).
- `pay_or_divert(from, to, amount, sink)`: if `to` is not program-owned and `to.lamports + amount < rent_exempt(to.data_len)`, credit `sink` instead and log `DIVERT`. Applies to tips, march fees, bonds, settlement rewards and rent refunds. **The sink is `Holding.pool_owed`** (lamports that stay in the Holding, swept later by SweepPoolOwed) in SettleTransit and every W, D or player instruction; the DefencePool is a sink only in N-class instructions that already list it (SweepPoolOwed, ReleaseDormant, CloseHolding, season-end closes). **No W or D instruction writes the DefencePool except ClaimDefence** (which exists to debit it, off every critical path) (DESIGN §8.6 rule 2; I-48). A rent refund of a whole account (≥ `rent(0)` = 650,240 lamports, v1.2: v1.1's 890,880 was the old per-byte rate) never diverts.
- **Tombstones** (a closed address is absent again): anchors — AnchorArchive `tombstone` bit set **before** the anchor closes; slots and days — the reveal window of their bell is closed for good and the latch holds; inputs — the Province has resolved or skipped past the bell **and GatherClash refuses any bell below `resolved_next`** (I-46), so a closed or never-needed ClashInputs cannot be created again; provinces, holdings and citizens — their creating instruction checks the season status (I-46). G2/G3 hold a re-creation test for every closable kind.
- **Rent** = `(128 + size) × 5,080` lamports.

### 4.3 Headers and event chains

**Chained header H (64 B)** — Season, Frontier, JoinShard, Citizen, Holding, Province, ClashInputs:

| Off | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | magic |
| 8 | 8 | season_id u64 |
| 16 | 2 | layout_version u16 (= 1) |
| 18 | 6 | reserved (0) |
| 24 | 8 | event_seq u64 (0 before the creation record) |
| 32 | 32 | event_head (32 zero bytes before the creation record) |

**Short header SH (16 B)** — every other account: magic (8) + season_id u64 (8). Short accounts are immutable or append-only and are verified by content against the logs.

Magics (8 ASCII bytes): `PSF1SEAS` Season, `PSF1FRNT` Frontier, `PSF1RING` RingSeed, `PSF1PFND` ProvinceFund, `PSF1JSHD` JoinShard, `PSF1BLOG` BeaconLog, `PSF1DPOL` DefencePool, `PSF1CITZ` Citizen, `PSF1HOLD` Holding, `PSF1PROV` Province, `PSF1ASLT` ArrivalSlot, `PSF1ADAY` ArrivalDay, `PSF1CLIN` ClashInputs, `PSF1SVRD` (reserved; SealVerdict removed), `PSF1ANCH` BellAnchor, `PSF1SEED` SeedCache, `PSF1ARCH` AnchorArchive, `PSF1DCLM` DefenceClaim.

## 5. Program interface (normative)

### 5.1 Clock and bell model (kernel `frontier::beacon`, CL-19/20)

All rule times come from the Clock sysvar's `unix_timestamp` on chain and from `GameClock` (§8.1) off chain — **never the wall clock**. Integers: bells u32, seconds i64, rounds u64.

| Quantity | Definition | Kernel fn |
|---|---|---|
| bell of t | `b(t) = ⌊(t − genesis_ts) / 600⌋`, t ≥ genesis_ts | `beacon::bell_at` (= `travel::bell_at`) |
| bell bounds | `bell_start(b) = genesis_ts + 600 b`, `bell_end(b) = bell_start(b + 1)` | `beacon::{bell_start, bell_end}` |
| round time | `round_time(r) = drand_genesis + (r − 1) × 3` (quicknet) | `beacon::round_time` |
| first round at or after t | smallest r with `round_time(r) ≥ t` | `beacon::first_round_from` |
| tlock round | **`T(b) = first_round_from(bell_end(b))`** | `beacon::tlock_round(clock, genesis_ts, b)` |
| anchor time | `A(b, r)` = Clock at the creation of THE BellAnchor `(b, r)` | stored in anchor and archive (`a_off = A − bell_end(b)`) |
| window | `W(b) = window_next` if `b ≥ window_from_bell`, else `reveal_window` (600–1,800 s; a change needs ≥ 144 bells' notice) | `beacon::window` |
| reveal close | `close(b, r) = A(b, r) + W(b)` | `beacon::reveal_close` |
| seed round | **`S(b, r) = first_round_from(close(b, r) + Δ)`**, `Δ = seed_margin ≥ 60` | `beacon::seed_round` |
| genesis round | **`first_round_from(t_create_min + 600 + Δ)`**, `t_create_min` from AnnounceSeason (CL-24) | `beacon::genesis_seed_round` |
| ring seed round | **`first_round_from(t_open + 600 + Δ)`** | `beacon::ring_seed_round` |
| roster freeze, posture close | `bell_start(b)` (wall-clock boundaries, never derived from T(b)) | — |
| day | `day(b) = b / 144` | — |
| resolved | `Province.resolved_next` = first bell neither resolved nor skipped | — |
| resident action at bell b | allowed iff `resolved_next + 1 ≥ b` (resolved through b − 2) and `holding.state == final` (I-29); a named host must not appear in any transit record of its Holding in state 1–3 (`HostInTransit`, I-44); effects pending until after b's clash | kernel `Host::check_issue` |
| arrival bell | `arrive ∈ [max(depart_bell + 2, earliest_arrival_bell(depart_ts, secs)), depart_bell + 72]` | `travel::check_arrival_bell` |
| reveal open | THE anchor present: `now < close ∧ BeaconLog(r).latest_round < S(A)`; anchor absent: archive `(r, day)` does not tombstone `arrive`; **and** ClashInputs `(dest, arrive)` absent **and** `dest.resolved_next ≤ arrive` (latch, I-07) | `beacon::reveal_open` + program |
| gather / skip allowed | `now ≥ close` (anchor or archive entry) | — |
| resolve allowed | gathered, and a SeedCache of THE anchor with round `S(A)` (or the archive's seed) | — |
| settle transit | `now ≥ close(arrive, r_dest) + 600` and `dest.resolved_next > arrive`; the seal is opened and judged inside (I-44) | — |
| ticket final | `now ≥ round_time(S(ticket_bell, r_site)) + 600` (stored as `Holding.final_ts`) **and** the Province's cohort for `ticket_bell` is closed: `settled == filed`, or `now_bell ≥ ticket_bell + 24` (I-47) | — |
| archive | `now ≥ A + archive_after` (172,800 s); tombstone before close | — |
| genesis_ts | `round_time(genesis_round) + 600` (set by CreateSeason) | — |

Economic timers (production, dormancy 5 days, release 10 days, shield, vigil) use Clock time; combat timers (stamina refill, cooldown) count resolved bells.

Per-player refundable rent: Citizen + Holding = **9,753,600 lamports ≈ 0.0098 SOL** (I-31, I-47). AnchorArchives of a 7-day season: 16 × 16 × 31.9M ≈ 8.2 SOL of refundable float (v1.1 stores each bell's signature, I-44; v1.3 halves each archive, which doubles their count).

### 5.3 Byte layouts

All integers little-endian; "rsv" = reserved, zero. Each layout file in `frontier-abi/src/layout/` has a const assertion that its last field ends at or before the size, and the offsets below are copied into `frontier-abi` exactly (the abi's vector test prints every offset; `web-frontier-codec.test.mjs` and `fclient` check them).

### 5.4 Error codes

`ProgramError::Custom(code)`; codes are stable forever; one svm test per (instruction, code) pair (G13).

| — | | 99 | NotImplemented (dev stubs only; `RELEASE_CHECK=1` fails if any path returns it) |

Keeper mapping (offchain P8): `SlotChanged` = 35, `WindowClosed` = 12 / 16 / 53 (stop), `NotAnchored` = 8, `SeedNotReady` = 54, `NotAllGathered` = 39, `AlreadyDone` = 52. PostAnchor/PostSeed on a present account return **success as a no-op** (≈ 1.75k CU, SP-V2), not 52.

### 5.5 Instruction tag map, classes and budgets

Instruction data: byte 0 = tag, then the listed fields, little-endian, fixed width, no borsh. **Budget** = the CU ceiling the M1 gate asserts at the named adversarial fill (§13.1); the client/keeper CU limit is the budgets table (`frontier-abi::budgets`, measured max + 5%, regenerated at the wave-5 gate). **Class** (keeper): W window-closing (escalate to P_def 2.0, pool-eligible), D delay-only (to P_delay 0.5), N non-critical, P player (priority 0 via relay), O operator. Heap ≤ 28 KiB at every gated fill (the allocator accepts up to 256 KiB under a heap frame, I-50); tx ≤ 1,232 B; locks ≤ 64; loaded data ≤ `L(kind)` (I-45).

"Top-level only" instructions refuse `get_stack_height() > 1` (`NotTopLevel`). The worst-case clash budget is **410k** from v1.10 (≤ 3 × GatherClash 40k + ResolveFromInputs 290k; 460k was the Phase A bound). Every transaction also carries `SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(L(kind))` from `budgets.rs` (§10.1, I-45). Budgets are gates; the keeper's retry ladder (§8.2, I-50) keeps a breach from freezing anything.

### 5.6 Common prologues

**Player prologue (P)** — accounts `[0] actor (s)`, `[1] payer (s,w)` (the funder; may equal actor; the relay's pool key in sponsored play), `[2] season (r)`, `[3] citizen (w)`, then the instruction's accounts. Checks, in order, within ≈ 1.5k CU:
1. season: owner, magic `PSF1SEAS`, id; effective status Running (Seeded ∧ now ≥ genesis_ts) else `WrongStatus`; **then** `ruleset_hash == RULESET_HASH` else `RulesetMismatch` (v1.2: the status first, so a season that is not Running reports `WrongStatus` whatever its ruleset; a missing signature is `Auth`, a writability mismatch `BadAccount`, as `check_flags`).
2. citizen: owner, magic, season, canonical address; `actor == wallet`, or `actor == session ∧ now < session_expiry` (else `Auth` / `SessionExpired`).
3. action bucket: refill `rate × Δt` (milli-tokens, cap `burst × 1,000`), debit 1,000, else `Bucket`.
4. `bell(now) < end_bell` (M1 has no post-end player action except those marked).
5. if the instruction names a holding: owner/magic/season/canonical address, `owner_citizen == citizen`; lazy finality flip, **only in instructions that carry the holding's Province** (resident actions): `state == 1 ∧ now ≥ final_ts ∧` the Province's cohort for `ticket_bell` is closed (I-47) → 2 (JoinShard `final_holdings` is **not** written here — the fold counts provisional and final alike; Citizen flag 4 set); `touch_owner(now)`; `Holding::settle(now)` (harvest is implicit).
6. if the instruction names a host (Dissolve, Explore, Depart): the host id appears in no transit record of the Holding in state 1–3, else `HostInTransit` (58; I-44). A host that stayed at a destination can act once its SettleTransit has landed.

**Keeper-write prologue (K)** — `[0] fee_payer (s,w)`, `[1] season (r)`; data carries `beneficiary [32]` where the table says so; the fee payer pays any rent and is stored as `rent_to` (I-49); evidence (§5.12) from the instructions sysvar for W writes and anchors/caches/inputs.

Note on SettleTicket "taken": to keep the ticket state machine moving without a failed transaction, a taken site returns **success** with the Citizen's `ticket_next += 1` and a `SETTLE` record with outcome `taken`. When `ticket_next == n`, the ticket is exhausted (`ticket_bell = u32::MAX`, cohorts marked settled, escrow kept for the next FileTicket); the player files again.

Note on cohorts (I-47): a Province keeps 8 cohort records; a record is free when `settled == filed` or `now_bell ≥ bell + 24`. The keeper settles every ticket of a cohort in descending score in the first slots after S, so honest cohorts close within a few slots and onboarding times are unchanged; an attacker who wants a site it did not win must hold the Province (or the winner's Citizen) against a class-D keeper for 24 bells.

### 5.10 Holdings and resident actions

All: player prologue + `[holding w]`; resident actions (Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Explore, Depart) also need `state == final` (`NotFinal`) and the province resolved through b − 2 (`NotResident`); Dissolve, Explore and Depart also need the host out of transit (`HostInTransit`, I-44).

### 5.11 Marches, reveals, clashes and transits

**Depart (0x50)** — player prologue + `[holding w] [province w] [system]`. Data: host_id u64, commit [32], seal [165], arrive_bell u32, tip u64, transit_slot u8 (219 B with the tag). Checks in order:
1. `holding.state == final` (`NotFinal`); province = the host's, resolved through b − 2 (`NotResident`).
2. `seal` byte 0 is a valid compressed-G2 flag (syntax only; validity is judged by SettleTransit, I-44) else `BadData`.
3. Host is the caller's, state 1, no pending op (`HostBusy`), in no transit record of the Holding in state 1–3 (`HostInTransit`, I-44); kernel `Host::depart(b, march_stamina(32), resolved_next)` (I-32; `Cooldown`/`NoStamina`).
4. `arrive_bell ∈ [now_bell + 2, min(now_bell + 72, end_bell − 1)]` (`ArrivalBell`; the exact earliest bell is Reveal's job). **v1.12:** no arrival at or after the season's `end_bell`: no anchor, gather, resolve or settlement can exist for such a bell (PostAnchor refuses it `BadData`, the clash instructions `WrongStatus`), so such a march could never settle; the last useful Depart bell is `end_bell − 3`.
5. `tip ≥ fees::min_tip_lamports(min_reveal_priority_milli, reveal_cu_limit)` (`TipTooLow`); transit slot free (`TransitState`); `payer.lamports ≥ tip + march_fee + seal_bond` (`Insufficient`).

Effects: `seal_root = sha256(commit ‖ sha256(seal))` computed by the program; transit record {state 1, host, unit, faction, origin, depart_bell, arrive_bell, depart_ts, dep_mass = troops, march_stamina, dealt_bps = doctrine, seal_root, tip, flags 1|2}; System transfer payer → holding of `tip + march_fee + seal_bond`, `escrow +=`; Province entry pending op Spend (becomes `departed`, state 3, at the bell's settle); Citizen `arrivals += 1`. Log `DEPART` with the commitment and the full seal.

**Reveal (0x51)** — class W, top-level only, no player signer. Accounts (in order):

4. destination (P, Q, tile) from plain; `r = region_of(P, Q)` (`WrongRegion` if the supplied anchor/archive/beaconlog are not r's); window: THE anchor `an‖(arrive, r)` present → `now < A + W(arrive)` and `beaconlog.latest_round < S(A)` else `WindowClosed`; absent → archive `aa‖(r, part(arrive))` (v1.3) must not tombstone `arrive` else `Archived`.
5. **latch**: inputs at `ci‖(P, Q, arrive)` absent else `LatchClosed`; `dest_province` canonical and `resolved_next ≤ arrive` else `LatchClosed`.
6. path: ≤ 32 steps of 3-bit directions from the origin tile; every step's province is the destination or one of the supplied path provinces (canonical); every step passable; last hex = destination tile; `travel::path_cost` × doctrine travel bps → `check_arrival_bell(genesis_ts, depart_ts, secs, arrive)` (`ArrivalBell`); destination tile is not the site of a shielded holding of another faction, and a host of a shielded holding may not target another faction's holding site (`Shielded`); else `Path`.
7. quota: read the 4 slots of `(dest, arrive, faction)` at their canonical addresses; `admit_arrival(p, arrive, &slots, SlotEntry{host_id, citizen_tag, dep_mass})`: `Refuse(_)` → `QuotaRefused` (nothing written); host already in a slot → `AlreadyDone`; `Fill{i}`/`Displace{i}` → `i == target_i` and that slot is the writable one, else `SlotMoved`.
8. ArrivalDay: if bit `arrive mod 144` is clear, account 8 must be writable (`NeedArrivalDay`); init pre-funding-safe if absent (`rent_to` = fee payer, I-49); set the bit.
9. evidence (§5.12).
Effects: slot created (`rent_to` = fee payer, I-49; `beneficiary` from the data) or overwritten on displacement (`rent_to` kept; `beneficiary`, `ev_*` replaced and `claimed = 0`; the displaced reveal's evidence is logged, not claimable, I-52); fields from plain and transit; `citizen_tag` from `holding.owner_citizen[0..8]`. **Nothing else is written.** Log `REVEAL` (host, dest, tile, stance, retreat, i, fill/displace, displaced host, beneficiary, evidence).

**SettleDeparture (0x52)** — `[payer s] [season] [origin province w] [holding w]`; data transit_slot u8. Checks: transit state 1; `province.resolved_next > depart_bell` (`TooEarly`); entry with the host id in state 3 (departed). Effects: `troops_after`, `stamina_after`, `ready_bell_off` from `Host::march_values`; state 2 (or 3 when destroyed at origin, troops 0); entry freed. Log `DEPARTURE_SETTLED`.

**GatherClash (0x60)** — K + `[province (dest) r] [anchor|archive r] [arrivalday r] [inputs w] [ix sysvar] [system] [slot_k r …] [holding_k r …]`.

Positions commute; repeats are no-ops. Log `GATHER`. Per gather ≤ 24 slot keys, ≤ 10 Holdings, ≤ 1,232 B; a full province-bell needs ≤ 3 gathers.

**ResolveFromInputs (0x61)** — K + `[province w] [inputs w] [seedcache|archive r] [anchor|archive r] [ix sysvar]`. Data: bell u32, beneficiary [32]. Checks: `bell == province.resolved_next` (`OutOfOrder`); `arrivals_mask == 0xFFFFFF` (`NotGathered`); seed from a SeedCache whose `anchor_key` is THE anchor and `round == S(A)` with A equal to THE anchor's, or from the archive entry (`SeedNotReady`). Effects: build `ClashInput` (residents in state 1 with `from_bell ≤ bell` at `Host::values_at(bell)` fighting at Hold; garrisons from the site mirror with `GarrisonState::at(bell)` and walls effective ≤ bell; arrivals = present records; terrain from the compact arrays; `Relations{peaceful: 0}`; **room `Occupancy{pending[f]` = entries in state 2 of faction f, `storage_free` = 56 − entries in states 1–3`}`** so arrivals are admitted only while roster + pending < 48, per faction < 8 and admitted < `storage_free`, the rest bouncing with no loss in kernel rank order (I-43); the camp as a NEUTRAL garrison on its tile, respawned first if the day's check is due (I-56)); `clash::resolve_clash` (Phase A); write back residents (`Host::apply_clash`), Stays/Withdrew arrivals → entries (state 1, `from_bell = bell + 1`), garrisons (`GarrisonState::apply_clash`), cleared camp → `camp.state = 0`, `WORKS_CAMP` credited to the winning faction's arrivals in the fate table (I-56); settle every pending op of the bell (`Host::settle`, `settle_merge`, `GarrisonState::settle`): musters join, departures → state 3 with post-clash values; inputs fate table, `flags |= 2`, `resolver = beneficiary`, evidence; Province `resolved_next = bell + 1`, digest, `roster_epoch += 1`. Log, in this order (v1.12): `CAMP` (spawn) when the day's check respawned the camp, `CAMP` (clear, troops 0) when the clash cleared the camp present at the clash — which may be the one this transaction just spawned — then `CLASH`.

**SkipQuiet (0x63)** — `[payer s] [season] [province w] [arrivalday_0 r] [arrivalday_1 r] [anchor_or_archive × n r]`. Data: b0 u32 (= `resolved_next`), n u8 (1–24). For each bell b in order: (1) window closed via THE anchor or the archive entry (`TooEarly`); (2) ArrivalDay bit of b clear (absent = clear), else stop (`NotQuiet`); (3) apply the pending ops that take effect at b; (4) `clash::is_quiet(rules, inp)` with no arrivals, cached by `(roster_epoch, relations)`; a non-quiet bell stops with `NotQuiet` if it is the first, otherwise the instruction commits the bells before it; (5) **before each bell after the first, if `sol_remaining_compute_units() < 40,000` the instruction commits the bells done so far** (I-50: a roster changed at every bell costs ≈ 25k per bell, so a 24-bell skip of a churned province needs ≈ 0.7M or several transactions). Effects: `resolved_next = b0 + k`, lazy timers; log `SKIP` with the quiet digest. Equivalence gate G11 (§13.3).

**ProveBadSeal (0x53)** — removed in v1.1 (I-44): SettleTransit opens and judges every seal, so the proof cannot be skipped or raced, and it still works after the anchor is archived.

**SettleTransit (0x54)** — class D, anyone. Accounts: `[payer s,w] [season] [holding w] [dest province w] [inputs w (or the canonical absent address)] [slot w (or canonical absent)] [home province w] [anchor|archive r (THE anchor of (arrive, r_dest), or its region-half-day archive `aa‖(r_dest, part(arrive))`, v1.3)] [slot_beneficiary w] [resolver w] [holding_rent_payer w] [settle_beneficiary w] [system]`. Data: transit_slot u8, commit [32], seal [165], beneficiary [32] (231 B with the tag; tx ≈ 990 B ≤ 1,100 B). Checks in order:
1. transit state 2 or 3 (`DepartureUnsettled` for 1, `TransitState` for 0).
2. `now ≥ close(arrive, r_dest) + 600` and `dest.resolved_next > arrive` (`TooEarly`).
3. `sha256(commit ‖ sha256(seal)) == transit.seal_root` (`CommitMismatch`): the pair judged is the logged pair.
4. **The proof (I-44):** the round-T(arrive) signature from THE anchor (present) or the archive entry's `sig` (archived; canonical addresses, `NoAnchor` otherwise); open the seal with the FO check; `commit' = sha256(DOMAIN_MARCH ‖ plain ‖ salt_of(k))` must equal `commit`; `Plain::validate(plain, host, arrive)`. Any failure → **bad seal** with code 1, 2, 4 or 5 (3 is reserved, v1.3); otherwise code 0 and `plain` is the march's order (whether or not it was revealed). Budget: the opener ≤ 48.0k [measured, SP-V2 ProveBadSeal], instruction 85k.
5. `settle_beneficiary == beneficiary`; ClashInputs are used **only if present with flag 2** (resolved, I-46); otherwise the "no final set" branch applies.

Outcome (D5, order-free):
- **Bad seal** → the host is destroyed: a Stays/Withdrew host still among the destination's entries gets pending op `Forfeit` (troops lost at the settle of `bell(now)`; past clashes are never re-run); a bounced or retreated host is not returned; the transit closes; **tip + march fee + bond → `settle_beneficiary`** (the prover's reward of DESIGN §6.2, now paid to whoever settles).
- else **resolved ClashInputs**: host in the records → fate (Stays/Withdrew: transit closed, host is a destination resident and may act from now on; Bounced/Retreated: returns home, no loss; Destroyed: gone); slot beneficiary gets the tip, inputs' resolver gets the march fee, bond → `holding.rent_payer`; `settled_mask` bit set. Host not in the records → compare `SlotEntry{host, citizen_tag, dep_mass}` with the faction's recorded final set: outranked by the 4th, or its citizen has a higher-ranked arrival → **bounce, no loss** (tip and bond → `holding.rent_payer`, fee → resolver); otherwise → **routed** (`rout_survivors`, stamina 0, tip → `Holding.pool_owed`, bond → rent payer, fee → resolver).
- else (no resolved inputs: closed, never gathered, or gathered without arrivals) → **routed** (tip and fee → `Holding.pool_owed`; bond → rent payer).
- **Slot (I-52):** closed to its `rent_to`, unless its evidence is claim-eligible (lateness ≥ `lateness_slots` against THE anchor's slot and a price above the tip level), unclaimed and `now < close + claim_grace` (6 bells): then only its `settled` flag is set and CloseArrivalSlot closes it later.
Returning hosts rejoin the home Province as a muster-pending entry if an entry and the caps allow, else troops go to `reserve`. Every payment uses `pay_or_divert` with sink `Holding.pool_owed`; **no DefencePool account is listed** (I-48). Log `TRANSIT_SETTLED` (outcome, seal code).

**Closes (0x64–0x66)**

| Tag | Accounts | Data | Checks | Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x64 CloseClashInputs | `[any s] [season] [province r] [inputs w] [rent_to w]` | P i16, Q i16, bell u32 | `flags & 2`; every present arrival's `settled_mask` bit set; `resolved_ts + clash_close_grace × 600 ≤ now − genesis_ts` (`InputsOpen`) | close → `rent_to` / `CLOSE` |
| 0x65 CloseArrivalDay | `[any s] [season] [province r] [day w] [rent_to w]` | P, Q, day u32 | `province.resolved_next ≥ 144 × (day + 1)` | close / `CLOSE` |
| 0x66 CloseArrivalSlot | `[any s] [season] [slot w] [rent_to w] ([anchor r] for case a)` | P, Q, bell, f, i | (a) the slot's `settled` flag is set and (`claimed` or `now ≥ close + claim_grace`); or (b) status Ended ∧ `now ≥ end + 72 h` (orphans of holdings closed at the end) | close / `CLOSE` |

### 5.12 Fee evidence and the defence pool

- **Evidence** (Reveal; also recorded on BellAnchor, and on ClashInputs at init and at resolve, for the liveness report): landing slot (Clock), `SetComputeUnitPrice` µlamports (0 if absent), `SetComputeUnitLimit`, `SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit`, read from the instructions sysvar (read-only key). The transaction's signature count is assumed 1 (keeper transactions have one signer).
- **ClaimDefence (0x70)** — class D. `[keeper s,w (= beneficiary)] [season] [dpool w] [claim w] [system] ([slot w] [anchor r]) × ≤ 6`. Data: day u32, n u8. Per slot: `beneficiary == keeper`, `claimed == 0`, `now < close + claim_grace` (6 bells; SettleTransit keeps an eligible slot open that long, I-52); lateness `ev_slot − anchor.slot ≥ lateness_slots` (reference: THE anchor of `(bell, r)`); `refund = fees::defence_refund(ev, season)` = `min(⌈ev_price × ev_limit / 10⁶⌉, defence_cap × cost − 2,500) − (tip_min − 2,500)` if positive (v1.2: rounded up, as the runtime charges the priority fee), `cost = ev_limit + 720 + 300 × (2 + created_day) + 8 × ceil(ev_loaded / 32,768)`, `created_day` = the slot's flags bit 2 (v1.2, `arrival_slot::evidence`); per-bell-region cap and per-keeper-day cap (`claim`). Effects: `claimed = 1`; pay the keeper from the pool (empty → partial, logged). Eligibility is **ArrivalSlot evidence only** (I-21). Log `DEFENCE_CLAIM`.
- **SweepPoolOwed (0x55)** — class N, anyone: `[any s] [season] [holding w] [dpool w]`; moves `pool_owed` lamports from the Holding to the DefencePool and zeroes it (ReleaseDormant and CloseHolding do the same). Log `POOL_SWEEP`. The pool therefore receives routed tips late, never on a critical or delay path (I-48).

## 6. Log records: the PS2 contract (verifier and herald input)

**Encoding.** One `sol_log_data(&[b"PS2", body])` per record; a transaction emits one record per account it writes (a record touching several chained entities carries all their heads). `body` =

| Part | Bytes | Content |
|---|---|---|
| head | 6 | `ver u8 = 1` ‖ `kind u8` ‖ `bell u32` (current bell; `u32::MAX` before genesis) |
| key | kind-specific, fixed | the entity key fields (§4.1 raw form, coordinates i32) |
| payload | kind-specific, fixed | the fields listed below, in order, LE |
| tail | `1 + 41 × n` | `n u8`, then n × `{entity_kind u8, seq u64, head [32]}` for every chained entity the record touches |

`entity_kind`: 1 Season, 2 Frontier, 3 JoinShard, 4 Citizen, 5 Holding, 6 Province, 7 ClashInputs. For each chained entity E: `E.seq += 1; E.head = sha256(E.head ‖ le64(E.seq) ‖ body_without_tail)`, and the tail carries the new `(seq, head)`. `frontier-abi::log` provides `encode`, `decode`, `chains_of(kind, key, payload) -> [(entity_kind, address)]`, and the head function; `frontier-abi/vectors/logs.json` pins one vector per kind. `body_without_tail` ≤ 128 B except DEPART (+ commit 32 + seal 165) and CLASH (+ fates ≤ 72 B).

The verifier (§8.5) walks each chain from these records and requires the final head to equal the on-chain account's (or, for closed accounts, the CLOSE record's). The herald folds these records per province and bell.

### 8.2 Keeper (`frontier-keeper`, lib `keeper-core`)

**Duties** (all rule times from `GameClock`):

| Duty | Trigger | Deadline | Transactions | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Genesis | `genesis_round` published | 7-day abort guard | ConsumeGenesisSeed; OpenRing 0..g; OpenProvince for every genesis province | D |
| Anchor | T(b) published (0.8–2 s after its time) | none | PostAnchorMulti **and** per-region PostAnchor fallbacks (fallbacks may lag 1 slot in peacetime). **v1.12:** only bells < `end_bell` (the plan stops at `end_bell − 1`; the program refuses later bells `BadData`); a round asked for and not yet served by drand is asked again within the slot, on the keeper's idle ticks, not once per slot | D |
| Seed caches | `S(b, r)` published | none | PostSeed(r, random unused nonce); switch nonce if not landed within 2 slots | D |
| BeaconLog | every bell | — | PostBeacon × 16 with the latest round | N |
| Decrypt | T(b) published | before `A + W` | open every seal targeted at T(b) (Rust tlock, parallel); check commit and root; a bad seal is flagged and destroyed at its SettleTransit (I-44) | — |
| Reveal | T(b) for keeper reveals; owner submissions from bell start | **never after `A + W − 2 slots`**; latch respected | Reveal per arrival, grouped by `(P, Q, b, faction)` and **sent in descending departure mass**, targeting the index `admit_arrival` computes; on `SlotMoved` re-read and retry ≤ 4 times; `QuotaRefused` / second arrival of a citizen → SettleTransit queue. **v1.12:** an arrival bell ≥ `end_bell` is never revealed; the keeper's two reveal sources (its opened seals and owner material) are deduplicated by `(host, arrive)`, so one march gets at most one Reveal per slot from one keeper | **W** |
| SettleDeparture | origin resolved past the departure bell (**v1.12:** plus `backup_delay_slots`, then the transit re-read) | none | SettleDeparture | D |
| Gather | `now ≥ A + W`, the province-bell has an ArrivalDay bit, every arrival's transit is in state ≥ 2 | none | GatherClash parts (≤ 10 arrivals per part); a clear bit → one gather (or SkipQuiet) | D |
| Resolve | all parts gathered, a SeedCache exists, `resolved_next == b` | none | ResolveFromInputs (CU limit from the budgets table) | D |
| Quiet skip | `resolved_next < b − 1` and the bits are clear; **v1.10 (W6-C): the skip goes out when its run of closed quiet bells covers the province's target bell** (a nudge: the next bell; a pending resident change or a `Leave`: its bell; a departure from here to settle: its departure bell; an arrival here ahead: the bell before it; an arrival bell left clear or a settlement judged against this province: that bell), **as a whole 24-bell batch, or at the season's end** — not one bell alone as each closes. **v1.12 (split rule):** a batch is split only for a latency-relevant target — a nudge, an arrival bell, a departure to settle, a pending `Spend` or `Leave` or a `Leave` entry (what SettleDeparture and the §21 return settle wait on; integ-W6t, U2 deviation 2); other pending resident changes (musters, splits, merges, forfeits) ride inside the whole 24-bell batch (SkipQuiet applies them at their own bell), and a sealed march whose destination is not yet known sets no target (no fallback to its origin) | none | SkipQuiet (≤ 24 bells) | D |
| Settle transit | `close + 600` passed and the destination resolved (**v1.12:** plus `backup_delay_slots`, then the transit re-read) | before `CloseClashInputs` grace | SettleTransit for every transit incl. quota-refused and unrevealed, with `commit` and `seal` from the DEPART log (the proof runs inside) | D |
| Tickets | `S(ticket_bell, r)` exists | cohort expiry (24 bells) | SettleTicket for every ticket of a (province, ticket_bell) cohort, **descending score, in the first slots after S**; expired tickets settled as `expired` | **D** |
| Explore | seed exists | — | SettleExplore | N |
| Archive | `A + 48 h` per region-half-day (v1.3) | — | ArchiveAnchors (tombstone, then close); CloseSeedCache | D / N |
| Closes | after resolution and settlement | — | CloseClashInputs, CloseArrivalDay, CloseArrivalSlot (after the claim grace). **v1.12:** accounts read in batches (`getMultipleAccounts`, ≤ 100 keys) with a per-key recheck time (the grace end once resolved and settled, else one bell later), after the tick's critical sends; a close key that ended `dead` is not re-planned until its account's lamports or data change | N |
| Fold | every bell while joins are open | — | FoldOccupancy (2 txs, same bell) | **D** |
| Rings | crowding rule holds on the folded values | — | OpenRing → ConsumeRingSeed → OpenProvince × 6d | **D** |
| Dormancy | `now ≥ last_owner_action + release_after` | — | ReleaseDormant; DisbandStranded | N |
| Defence claims | contested bells with landed late Reveals | within `close + claim_grace` (6 bells) | ClaimDefence (≤ 6 slots per tx) | **D** |
| Sweeps | `pool_owed > 0` on a Holding | — | SweepPoolOwed | N |
| Payer care | a payer outside its pool's band (below); **v1.10 (W6-C): care runs at rest, never over pending care transfers — on the first tick, every `care_every_slots` slots or `care_every_game_secs` (300) game seconds whichever comes first, and 2 slots after a care that planned top-ups while a pool is below its minimum effective N** (`keeper.toml` keys `care_every_game_secs`, `d_resend_slots`, `cap_resend_slots`) | — | fund from a funder / sweep to a funder (never inside a critical tx) | N |

**Bid policy (spec):** W writes start at `p_start` (= `p_tip` by default; `--peace-start f` sets `f × p_tip`) and double every slot to **P_def 2.0** (capped by `Season.defence_cap_milli`); D writes double to **P_delay 0.5**; N writes use a fixed low bid. **Resend: W writes every slot; D and N writes, while a version is in flight, the next version `d_resend_slots` (2) slots after the last (counted from the chain slot it went out at) while the bid rises and every `cap_resend_slots` (16) slots at the class cap; a version whose failure is known is followed at once; contested detection every slot (v1.10, W6-C; v1.0–v1.9 said "every slot" for every class). Each bid level is a new signature from a newly drawn random payer.** CU limit from the budgets table; **`SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(L(kind))` from the budgets table on every transaction** (I-45; v1.0's 65,536 would make every transaction against a ≈ 0.5–1 MB program fail `MaxLoadedAccountsDataSizeExceeded` and still pay its fee). **Retry ladder (I-50):** `ComputeBudgetExceeded` → resend at `min(2 × limit, 1,400,000)`, then 1,400,000; a heap access fault → resend with `RequestHeapFrame(262,144)`; each retry is journalled and alerted (a budget breach is a gate failure to fix, never a stuck province). **v1.12 (CU exhaustion):** a `ProgramFailedToComplete` whose consumed units equal the CU limit, or whose logs contain `exceeded CUs meter`, is CU exhaustion and climbs the CU rungs like `ComputeBudgetExceeded`, never the heap rung (the keeper fetches `getTransaction` meta when the error JSON alone cannot tell); a write that fails on every rung ends `dead`. Contested detection: a W or D write not landed within 2 slots at a bid ≥ `p_tip` marks `(bell, region)` contested → W writes for that region start at `p_tip`, anchor fallbacks every slot, alert, evidence journalled. Duplicate versions are bounded by `resends × (base + fee) ≤ per_write_cap`. **v1.3:** a write at its version or spend cap whose every version's blockhash has expired (151 slots) ends as a failure with a backoff and an alert (`write-expired`), and the duty re-plans it with a fresh escalation; the anchor scan window always reaches the newest bell (a bell left behind with an anchor missing is alerted, `anchor-missing`), so a long hold delays, never stalls (§8.2 "delay only").

**Payers (I-49):** two pools per keeper fleet: `pool_id = "reveal"` for class W (**N ≥ 150** enforced at start, refuses below unless `--dev`) and `pool_id = "delay"` for classes D and N (N ≥ 32); `payer_i = ed25519(sha256("PS-FRONTIER-PAYER-v1" ‖ master_seed ‖ pool_id ‖ le32(i)))`; uniform random draw per transaction version (OS CSPRNG), payers below the floor skipped, **no round-robin**. **The payer pays rent and gets it back** (`rent_to` = payer), so a pool refills as slots, days, inputs and anchors close; tips and rewards go to the configured beneficiary. **Band:** reveal floor `F_r = 3 × ⌈R99 / N⌉ × (rent(slot) + rent(day) + fee(P_def, reveal))` with R99 = the c4 v3 p99 reveals per bell for one fleet (CL-26; default 4,000 → F_r ≈ 0.215 SOL, ceiling 2 F_r; 150 payers ≈ 32–65 SOL, test SOL in M1); delay floor `F_d = 3 × (p99 per-bell D creation rent) / N_d` (default 0.5 SOL). **Effective N** = payers above the floor; below 150 the keeper alerts and tops up at once from **≥ 4 funder keys** (drawn at random, batched at rest and before any bell marked contested, never inside a critical transaction). It **does not stop sending W writes** (stopping would be the exclusion C4 guards against). Per-bell effective N goes into the liveness report and gates E5 criterion 4.

**Crash safety:** the chain is the state; SQLite journal (WAL, `synchronous=FULL` for `attempts`): `attempts(sig, kind, object_key, bell, region, class, payer, bid_milli, cu_limit, first_valid_slot, sent_slot, landed_slot, status)`, `plaintexts(host, bell, plain, salt)`, `cursor`, `claims`, `payers`. Startup: flock → reconcile in-flight with `getSignatureStatuses` → catch up ingest → rebuild queues → resume.

**Config `keeper.toml`:** `rpc = [..]`, `drand = [..]`, `roles = ["beacon","reveal","settle-departure","gather","resolve","skip","settle","tickets","explore","archive","close","fold","rings","dormancy","claims","sweep"]`, `regions = "0-15"`, `reveal_pool ≥ 150`, `delay_pool ≥ 32`, `funders ≥ 4`, `r99_reveals`, `p_def_milli ≤ season cap`, `p_delay_milli = 500`, `daily_budget_sol`, `beneficiary`, `api = "127.0.0.1:<port>"`, `token_file`, **`backup_delay_slots`** (v1.12; u32, default 0: SettleDeparture and SettleTransit wait this many slots after they first become eligible, then re-read the transit before sending, so a backup keeper does not race the primary; Reveals are unchanged; the stack's keeper B uses 8).

**Loopback API** (127.0.0.1 only; bearer token from `token_file`):

| Route | Body | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/reveal` | `{holding: b58, transit_slot: u8, plain_b64 (37 B), salt_b64 (32 B), ct_hash_b64 (32 B)}` | `202 {accepted: true, track: id}`; `409 {code: "CommitMismatch"}`; `409 {code: "TransitState"}`; **v1.12:** `409 {code: "Shielded"}` (§5.11 step 6 judged at acceptance: the host's own Holding is shielded at `bell_start(arrive)` and not dormant and the target is another faction's holding site, or the destination tile is the site of another faction's shielded holding) and `409 {code: "ArrivalBell"}` (`arrive ≥ end_bell`, whatever the season status); `410 {code: "WindowClosed"}`; `422 {code: "BadPlaintext"}`. Every refusal body is `{error, code, detail}` (v1.12, integ-W6t: `error` = `code`, the field the relay and the bots read; `code` kept for older clients) |
| `POST /v1/nudge` | `{province: [P, Q], bell}` | `{queued: true, blocking: [{kind, key}]}` |
| `GET /v1/track/{id}` | — | `{state: "queued|sent|landed|refused|expired", signature?, slot?, code?}` |
| `GET /v1/status` | — | duties per bell, lag, pool balances, spend. **v1.12:** answers within 1 s while a tick runs (served from a snapshot taken at the end of each tick, off the tick's critical path); the latency fields are under `duties` (`anchor_latency_slots_p99`, `seed_latency_slots_p99`, …), the payer pools under `pools` (`pools.reveal.floor`, `effective_n`) |
| `GET /metrics` | — | Prometheus text (latencies, landed/failed per kind, contested regions, spend, beacon lag) |

### 8.3 Relay (`permutation-gateway/src/frontier/`, Node)

Reuses `cosign.mjs`, `guards.mjs`, `send.mjs`, `routes/errors.mjs`, the two-listener `app.mjs` pattern and `config.mjs`. Public listener routes (the herald proxies them as `/gw/*`):

| Route | Request | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /f/season` | — | `{programId, season, cluster, relayPool: 150, quotas, heraldUrl}` |
| `GET /f/relay` | — | `{feePayer, blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight, programId, quota: {left, resetsAt}}`; feePayer drawn uniformly from the relay pool (`pool_id = "relay"`, 150 keys) |
| `POST /f/relay` | `{tx: base64 legacy wire}` signed by every signer except the fee payer | `{ok: true, signature}` or `{ok: false, code}`; exact parse → **shape allowlist** → `signedBy` → drain guard (simulate with sigs; relay payer's Δlamports ≤ fee + allowed rent/escrow for that kind) → co-sign → send |
| `POST /f/join` | `{tx, invite?}` (wallet-signed Join; payer = relay key) | as `/f/relay`; when the season's `join_gate` is set the relay co-signs with the gate key only for a valid one-time invite, else `InviteRequired` (I-51) |
| `POST /f/reveal` | `{holding, transit_slot, plain_b64, salt_b64, ct_hash_b64}` | forwarded to the keeper `POST /v1/reveal`; answer passed through (**v1.12:** the keeper's `409 {error: "Shielded", code: "Shielded", …}` and `409 {error: "ArrivalBell", …}` bodies reach the client byte-identical) |
| `POST /f/nudge` | `{province: [P, Q], bell}` | forwarded to `/v1/nudge` |
| `GET /f/tx/{signature}` | — | `{state: "landed|failed|expired|unknown", slot?, code?}` |
| `GET /f/quota?citizen=` | — | `{left, resetsAt, lamportsLeft}` |
| `POST /f/operator/invites`, `GET /f/operator/pool` | operator token | invites; pool balances |

**Shape allowlist** (`shapes.mjs`, vectors shared with the web): exactly `[SetComputeUnitLimit(budget), SetComputeUnitPrice(0), SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(L(kind)), one Frontier player instruction ∈ {0x30–0x33, 0x40–0x46, 0x50}]` with the authority signature verified, **or** a settle shape `[SetComputeUnitLimit, SetComputeUnitPrice(0), SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(L(kind)), one of {0x47 SettleExplore, 0x54 SettleTransit}]` with no authority signature; program id matches; fee payer ∈ relay pool; the `payer` account = the fee payer; **v1.3: the message's account keys are exactly the fee payer, the instruction's accounts and the two program ids (no unreferenced key), and every key's writability is the ABI's** (writable iff the fee payer or at a writable position; program ids and read-only accounts read-only) — an unreferenced or over-writable key would be a relay-paid write lock the program never sees. **Drain guard (I-51):** simulate with signatures; the relay payer's Δlamports ≤ fee + the kind's allowance: Join = rent(Citizen); FileTicket = the Holding-rent escrow shortfall; Depart = `tip + march_fee + seal_bond` with **`tip` ∈ {tip_min, ⌈1.5 × tip_min⌉, 2 × tip_min}** (else `TipNotPreset`); every other kind 0; **`SetComputeUnitPrice` must be 0** on every sponsored shape. **Settle shapes are charged to the requester** — v1.3: `POST /f/relay {tx, requester, requesterSig, citizen}` charges `citizen:<citizen>` only when `requesterSig` is `requester`'s signature of the message **and** `citizen` is this season's canonical Citizen of its stored wallet whose wallet or unexpired session key is `requester` (read on chain); anything else, and an anonymous caller, is charged to the client-address bucket (a requester key never opens a bucket of its own) — never to the named holding's citizen, and **nothing is charged when simulation fails** (the transaction is not sent). **Any Reveal (0x51) shape → `400 UseRevealRoute`.** **v1.12 (optional):** a sponsored Depart whose `arrive_bell ≥ end_bell` may be refused `ArrivalBell` before simulation, with no quota debit (the program refuses it anyway, §5.11 step 4). Refusal codes: the `cosign.mjs` `refusal()` codes plus `QuotaExceeded {retryAt}`, `InviteRequired`, `UseRevealRoute`, `TipNotPreset`, `RelayRejected`, `OperatorLowFunds` (503). Residual, accepted and reported: a player who self-reveals its own sponsored march can collect that march's preset tip (≤ 2 × tip_min ≈ 29k lamports, ≤ 24 marches a day under the quota).

**Quotas (D4):** 40 sponsored transactions per citizen per game day for days 0–6, then 20; burst 60; sponsored lamports per citizen per game day ≤ 24 Depart escrows + rent at Join and SettleTicket; per-IP limits (`/f/relay` 40 burst / 2 per s, `/f/join` 10 / 0.2 per s, `/f/reveal` 40 / 2 per s); ReplayCache 30 min; FundsGuard; loopback clients (bots) exempt from IP limits, not from quotas. **Client address (I-51):** the relay's public listener binds 127.0.0.1 only and trusts `X-Forwarded-For` only when the TCP peer is the herald's loopback address; otherwise it uses the peer address. Invites: one-time HMAC tokens (playtest preset), enforced on chain through `Season.join_gate`; AnnounceSeason is limited to the program's upgrade authority, so season ids cannot be squatted.

JS SDK (`permutation-gateway/client/src/frontier/`): `codec.mjs` (layouts from `frontier-abi` vectors), `addresses.mjs`, `seal.mjs` (plaintext, salt, commit, root, envelope; IBE in the browser worker), `fees.mjs`, `budgets.mjs`, `shapes.mjs`, `herald.mjs`; synced to `web/sdk/frontier/` by `scripts/sync-web-sdk.mjs` (`--check` freshness test).

### 8.4 Herald (`frontier-herald`, lib `herald-fold`)

| Path | Content | Cache |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /h/season` | JSON: `{v:1, programId, cluster, season, genesisTs, bellSecs, W, delta, drand: {chainHash, publicKey, period, genesis}, rulesetHash, rMax, rings: [{d, seed}], tipPriorityMilli, revealCuLimit, marchFee, sealBond, quotas, headSeq, latestSlot, latestUnix, bytes_b64 (Season account)}` | `max-age=30`, ETag |
| `GET /h/overview/{ring}/{bell}.bin` (+ `/latest.bin`) | binary, §9.3 | immutable once every province of the ring resolved `bell`; latest `max-age=5` |
| `GET /h/province/{P},{Q}/{bell}` (+ `/latest`) | JSON envelope §9.2 with the Province bytes after that bell's resolve or skip, and that bell's ArrivalSlots, ArrivalDay and ClashInputs bytes (captured before close) | immutable; latest `max-age=2` |
| `GET /h/clash/{P},{Q}/{bell}` | `{v:1, inputs_b64, seed, anchor: {key, A, round}, cache: {key, nonce}, outcomeDigest, inputDigest, decoded: {fighters, engagements, fates}, heraldCheck: "match|MISMATCH"}` (recomputed natively with `resolve_clash`) | immutable |
| `GET /h/bell/{bell}/region/{r}` | anchor (A, round, sig), `S`, caches (nonces, seed), tombstone/archived state, per-province resolved flags | immutable once seeded |
| `GET /h/me/{wallet}` | Citizen, ≤ 3 Holdings (bytes), their hosts, transit records, open slots, settled seal codes, relay quota | `no-store` |
| `GET /h/events?after={seq}` | PS2 records decoded + raw (`{seq, slot, sig, kind, body_b64}`), 500 per page | full pages immutable |
| `WS /h/ws` | client → `{op:"sub", provinces:[[P,Q]…≤64], rings:[…], wallet?, bells:true}`; server → `{seq, s, kind:"acct|bell|event", key, slot, head, bytes_b64, t}` (`t` the ingest stamp, `s` the send stamp, unix ms; v1.13); heartbeat 15 s; a `seq` gap → client resyncs from files | — |
| `/frontier/*` | the static web client | long max-age (hashed names) |
| `/gw/*` | proxy to the relay's public listener (forwards only `Content-Type`, adds `X-Forwarded-For`, as `permutation-server/src/play/proxy.rs`; the relay trusts it only from this loopback peer) | — |

Fold rules: every capture stamped `(slot, seq, head)`; per-bell files written atomically (temp + rename, `.br`/`.gz` siblings); **byte-identical output from the same archive** (determinism test); herald is never a trust root. Security headers as `permutation-server/src/play/http.rs`; CSP for `/frontier/*` as web §12.

### 8.5 Verifier v2 (`frontier-verify`, lib `verify-core`)

Inputs: program id, season id, RPC URL(s) or `--archive DIR` (speed-up only), pinned quicknet info, expected ruleset hash, optional `--keeper-journal`. Reads final on-chain account states at a pinned slot and requires every replayed chain to reach them (K4). Fails closed (K2): a missing transaction or undecodable record is FAIL. Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 cannot verify.

| # | Check | FAIL codes (warn = PASS with warning) |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | entity chains (§6) | `ChainGap`, `HeadMismatch`, `DuplicateEvent`, `UnknownEntity` |
| V2 | program id, `.so` hash per slot range, ruleset hash, announce → create consistency | `ProgramMismatch`, `RulesetMismatch`, `AnnounceMismatch` |
| V3 | randomness: every anchor, cache and beacon re-verified (blstrs) against the pinned key; one anchor per (bell, region) at its canonical address incl. after archive; `S = first_round_from(A + W + Δ)`; genesis and ring rounds by rule | `BeaconSigInvalid`, `DuplicateAnchor`, `NonCanonicalAddress`, `SeedRoundRule`, `GenesisSeedRule`, `RingSeedRule` |
| V4 | windows: every landed Reveal has Clock < `A + W` and precedes the province-bell's first gather (latch) | `RevealAfterClose`, `RevealAfterLatch` |
| V5 | seals: every Depart seal opened with the stock `tlock` crate + PS-KS body + commitment + `Plain::validate`; revealed plaintext = opened; **every TRANSIT_SETTLED seal code agrees with stock decryption** (code > 0 ⇔ stock fails, commitment mismatch or invalid plaintext); **a bad seal whose transit settled with any other outcome is a FAIL** | `RevealCommitMismatch`, `VerdictDisagreesWithTlock`, **`BadSealSurvived`**, **`ArrivalAfterEnd`** (v1.12: a landed DEPART with `arrive_bell ≥ end_bell`, a program-invariant breach); warn: `ValidSealUnrevealed` (**v1.10, W6-C: only a valid seal settled `ROUTED` unrevealed; other unrevealed valid seals are listed in `liveness.unrevealed_by_rule` as `(host, arrive, outcome)`; E5 criterion 4 reads the warning as before**), `RevealNearClose`, `BadSealUnsettled` (a transit still unsettled at the end; E5 criterion 1 gates it). **v1.12 (rule refusals):** a valid seal whose Reveal §5.11 step 6 refuses by rule is judged **from the post-states and the plaintext, not from error codes** — the host's own Holding shielded at `bell_start(arrive)` and not dormant with another faction's holding site as target (`shielded-own`), the destination the site of another faction's shielded holding (`shielded-dest`), the path (`path`), the arrival bell (`arrival-bell`) — and is listed in `liveness.unrevealed_by_rule[]` as `{host, arrive, outcome, reason}` with `reason` ∈ {`shielded-own`, `shielded-dest`, `path`, `arrival-bell`, `bounced`}; it is not `ValidSealUnrevealed` whatever its outcome (a rule-refused march settles ROUTED). Failed Reveal attempts are counted per march `(host, arrive)`, not per host |
| V6 | quotas: final slots = the 4 largest revealed arrivals by `(mass, slot_key)`, one per citizen; dep_mass = Depart's | `QuotaSetMismatch`, `TransitMassMismatch` |
| V7 | replay: every province-bell re-run with `resolve_clash` from the logged inputs; SkipQuiet runs re-checked quiet, and no bell of a run has a revealed arrival (**v1.12, integ-W6t:** judged against every REVEAL of the run, before or after the SKIP); holdings/hosts/citizens through the kernel's lazy functions; transits (settle, bounce, rout, destroy) | `ClashReplayMismatch`, `SkipNotQuiet`, `SkipOverArrival`, `HoldingReplayMismatch`, `TransitOutcomeMismatch` |
| V8 | lag witness: every gathered arrival's values = the origin's departure-bell resolve (via SettleDeparture) | `OriginValueMismatch` |
| V9 | accounts at canonical addresses; pre-funded addresses never blocked an init (informational) | `NonCanonicalAddress` |
| V11 | land: every SETTLE recomputes `score = rng(S(ticket_bell, r), "site", P‖Q‖site‖citizen_tag)` with S by rule; displacement only inside the cohort (same `ticket_bell`) of a provisional holding; each site's cohort winner = the highest settled score; cohort counters; PROVINCE_OPEN terrain digest = `terrain::generate_province(ring_seed, p)`; camps (initial and respawns) = `camp::place`; **v1.12:** a CAMP clear (troops 0) is judged against the camp present at the clash: state 1 when a CAMP spawn of the same (P, Q) was logged earlier in the same transaction (a camp spawned earlier in the same transaction by the day check, whose `day` = the CLASH bell / 144), otherwise the camp before the transaction, and the camp is state 0 after; genesis ring seeds = `sha256("PSF-RING" ‖ genesis_seed ‖ le16(d))` | `TicketScoreMismatch`, `DisplacementRule`, `CohortMismatch`, `TerrainMismatch`, `CampMismatch`, `RingSeedRule` |
| V12 | explore: every EXPLORE_RESULT = `explore::roll(S(record.bell, r), …)` with the floor flag | `ExploreRollMismatch` |
| V13 | payments: every TRANSIT_SETTLED, SETTLE and DEFENCE_CLAIM payment by rule (recipients, amounts, `pay_or_divert`, `pool_owed`, `fees::defence_refund` within caps) FAILS on mismatch; global lamport conservation (rent, fees) is informational in M1 | `PaymentMismatch`, `DefenceRefundMismatch`; warn: `ConservationGap` |
| V10 | report | `report.json` (schema below) + `report.md` |

**Tamper classes (each MUST FAIL with the named code):** T1 drop a Depart (`ChainGap`/`HeadMismatch`); T2 flip a Reveal plaintext byte (`RevealCommitMismatch`); T3 shift an anchor's A (`SeedRoundRule`); T4 inject a second anchor (`DuplicateAnchor`); T5 swap a cache signature (`SeedRoundRule`/`BeaconSigInvalid`); T6 `set_account` on a Province after a resolve (`ClashReplayMismatch`/`HeadMismatch`); T7 mark a valid seal's TRANSIT_SETTLED as bad-seal (`VerdictDisagreesWithTlock`); T8 change which slot a displacement hit (`QuotaSetMismatch`); T9 alter a departure mass (`TransitMassMismatch`); T10 wrong quicknet key (`BeaconSigInvalid`); T11 wrong ruleset hash (`RulesetMismatch`); T12 truncate the last game day (`HeadMismatch`); T13 move a Reveal past `A + W` (`RevealAfterClose`); T14 duplicate a transaction (`DuplicateEvent`); T15 origin values from a later bell (`OriginValueMismatch`); T16 wrong genesis round (`GenesisSeedRule`); **T17** a SkipQuiet over a bell that has an ArrivalSlot (`SkipNotQuiet`/`SkipOverArrival`; v1.12, integ-W6t: built on a skip whose end bell's Reveal precedes it when the run has one); **T18** a tampered SETTLE score (`TicketScoreMismatch`); **T19** a tampered terrain digest (`TerrainMismatch`); **T20** a ClaimDefence amount above the formula (`DefenceRefundMismatch`); **T21** a tampered explore find (`ExploreRollMismatch`); **T22** a bad-seal transit logged as Stays (`BadSealSurvived`); **T24** (v1.12) a DEPART arriving at `end_bell` (`ArrivalAfterEnd`). The suite also judges the extra classes T1b, T6b, T23, T23b, H1, H1b, V9a (wave 5), so a run judges 30 classes, 23 of them required. **Checks of the checks:** cargo feature `mutate-<check>` disables one check; its tamper must then PASS, and the test asserts that. **Honest-but-adverse fixtures that MUST PASS:** keeper crash mid-bell, held anchor, lagging origin, displacement, low-tip rout (at `tip_min`, keeper B off), bad seal destroyed at settlement (revealed in-bell and unrevealed; settled before and after archive), ticket cohort with a displacement and an expired ticket, pre-funded addresses, archived anchors and tombstones, quota-refused arrival settled without loss, SkipQuiet runs.

### 8.6 Bots (`frontier-bots`, lib `frontier-agents`)

Profiles copied from `frontier-sim/src/model.rs` with a field-equality test (I-36); default mix = the simulator's suite mix (bots 5%); join schedule = the simulator's. Observations only from the herald (same read path as people) plus own accounts; every write through the relay (`/f/join`, `/f/relay`, `/f/reveal`). Policy: FileTicket → (keeper settles) → Harvest/Build/Train within the queue → Muster → Explore → Depart with a Rust tlock seal to `tlock_round(arrive)` (plaintext and salt journalled) → owner in-bell reveal for a profile-dependent share → SettleTransit. Pacing within the 30/h bucket. **v1.10 (W6-C, A6): `frontier-bots --day0-share F` (the share of the fleet that joins on day 0) and `--eager-personas` (every persona reaches its test within the first game hours, the in-process day's pacing); with `--rpc` the fleet's game clock follows the chain's Clock sysvar. `frontier-stack up` passes both (`--day0-share 1 --eager-personas`) when the run is shorter than one game day or the config sets `eager_bots = true` (W6-A), only if the fleet's `--help` lists them.** **v1.12 (the `w6-s7` triage):** `plan_march` sets `arrive = min(earliest + 1 + extra, dep_bell + 72, end_bell − 1)` and makes no Depart when `earliest ≥ end_bell`; once the real `arrive` is known, war targets (another faction's holding site) are dropped while the bot's own Holding is shielded at `bell_start(arrive)` and not dormant, and a destination's shield is judged at `arrive` (not at `bell + 4`); Muster skips a province with no free entry; the fleet journals `accepted` on a 2xx from `/f/reveal` and `revealed` only when a REVEAL of `(host, arrive)` is observed, and `bots/report.json.unrevealed[]` lists `{bot, persona, host, arrive, route, last_code}` for every march never revealed. **Adversarial personas** (on by default in the exit run, each ≤ 1% of bots, expected outcome in brackets): `min_tip` (tip exactly `tip_min`, never self-reveals) [revealed by keepers; PASS]; `garbage_seal` (random 165 B with a valid commitment; its owner reveals in-bell only when the other reveals look favourable) [destroyed at SettleTransit, whatever the fight's result; verifier agrees]; `bad_plaintext` (valid seal over an invalid plaintext) [destroyed at SettleTransit, seal code 5]; `settle_racer` (garbage seal, Stays host, settles at the earliest instant and tries to Depart the host again first) [Depart refused `HostInTransit`; destroyed]; `prefunder` (lamports to future slot, day, inputs, anchor, cache addresses) [nothing blocked]; `squatter` (100-troop hosts into a faction's slots) [displaced]; `late_revealer` (Reveal at and after `A + W` and after the first gather) [refused]; `forger` (non-canonical anchor/cache/slot/inputs keys) [refused]; `spammer` (exhausts bucket and quota) [429 / `Bucket`]; `double_arrival` (two arrivals of one citizen into one province-bell) [second bounced without loss]; `zero_tip` (Depart with tip 0) [refused `TipTooLow`]; `self_tip` (sponsored Depart at 2 × tip_min, self-reveal with itself as beneficiary) [collects ≤ 2 × tip_min; reported]; `ticket_holder` (its own low-score ticket settled first, then holds the Province with `frontier_hold` at a D-capped price for 3 bells) [the higher score still displaces it; finality waits for the cohort].

### 8.7 Local chain node and drand replay

- **`frontier-localnet`**: LiteSVM 0.16 with the mainnet feature set incl. the SIMD-0388 BLS12-381 syscalls, the pinned release SBPF v2 `.so`, rent 5,080 lamports/byte, 64 account locks; block builder per slot, **400 ms of real time at every scale** (I-54), ordering by priority, ≤ 100M per block and ≤ 40M per writable account **counted in the §10.1 cost** (v1.3: CU limit + 720 per signature + 300 per write lock + 8 per 32 KiB of the loaded limit, as Agave's cost tracker; not the CU limit alone); Clock `unix_timestamp = G0 + Σ_slots 0.4 × scale` (monotone; `frontier_setScale` changes the rate at a slot boundary; the pre-season runs at scale 2,000 so AnnounceSeason's 24-h lead takes ≈ 43 s; G0 a past date so every needed round exists). **Loaded-data accounting (I-45):** a transaction whose Σ(account data + 64) incl. the LoaderV3 programdata exceeds its requested limit fails `MaxLoadedAccountsDataSizeExceeded` with the fee charged, as SIMD-0186; a control test proves it (one page below the need fails, at the need passes); if LiteSVM 0.16 does not enforce it, `localnet` checks before execution. RPC subset (web3.js 1.99 + `send.mjs` + `fclient`): `getLatestBlockhash, sendTransaction, simulateTransaction (accounts post-state), getAccountInfo, getMultipleAccounts, getSignatureStatuses, getTransaction, getSignaturesForAddress, getSlot, getBlockHeight, getBlockTime, getBalance, getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption, getProgramAccounts (memcmp), requestAirdrop, getEpochInfo, getVersion, getHealth`; WS `slotSubscribe, signatureSubscribe, logsSubscribe` (optional). Loopback extensions: `frontier_feed(after)`, `frontier_pause`, `frontier_resume`, `frontier_setScale`, `frontier_snapshot`, `frontier_restore`, `frontier_hold(keys, priority_milli, slots)` (contention emulator), `frontier_setAccount` (tamper fixtures only; refused unless started with `--allow-tamper`). Crash safety: tx WAL + snapshot every 36 game bells; restore is deterministic.
- **`drand-replay`**: serves `/{chain}/info`, `/{chain}/public/latest`, `/{chain}/public/{round}` from a verified local archive of **real historical quicknet rounds**, only when `round_time + delay ≤ game_now` (v1.2 wording; `delay` 0.8–2.0 s is quicknet's publication latency, so a round is never released early), else 425. With `ClockSource::Chain`, `game_now` is the last observed Clock `unix_timestamp`, never an extrapolation (v1.2). **Archive (I-53):** the game clock runs contiguously from G0 through the pre-season and 7 game days, so the archive is **contiguous**: ≈ 8.5 game days + margin ≈ **250,000 rounds** (≈ 40 MB JSON, ≈ 12 MB packed), fetched one round per request from the public drand HTTP endpoints at ≤ 20 requests/s per endpoint over 3 endpoints (≈ 1.2 h), verified with blstrs as fetched; only after O-M1-12. **`--test-key` mode (I-53):** rounds signed on demand by a deterministic local key (`sk = hash_to_field("PSF-TEST-BEACON-v1")`), accepted only by a program built with feature `test-beacon` (pins that key's public key and its own `QUICKNET_PK_HASH`, carries the marker `PSF_TEST_BEACON_BUILD`, refused by `build-frontier.sh` for any deployable build); the herald serves the matching chain info so bots and the web seal to it. In-process gates, nightlies and rehearsals use it; W6's real-round runs and the exit use the release `.so` and the archive (a test-key build does not test the release binary).

### 8.8 Account locks and their prices (v1.1, I-48; extends DESIGN §8.6)

"Holding" an account = listing it writable in the attacker's own transactions at priority p; the price is p × 40M CU per block for up to ~20–60 known accounts per stream [measured, SP-FEE]. Prices use DESIGN §8.7's model for 10 minutes ($150/SOL); the keeper cap sets p. Only writes count against the per-account cap; read contention was not measured.

| Account (writers) | Keeper class, cap | Effect while held | Price per 10 min | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ArrivalSlots of a province-bell (Reveal) | W, 2.0 | reveals wait; routed if still held at close | $9.9k–27.2k (DESIGN §8.7) | one province-bell |
| Keeper payer (all keeper writes) | W 2.0 / D 0.5 | that payer's writes wait | whole block while ≥ 150 rotating reveal payers | none while effective N ≥ 150 (I-49) |
| Province (players P; FileTicket P; gathers, resolves, skips, settles, SettleTicket D) | D, 0.5 | resolution, settlement and ticket finality wait; the lottery winner changes only if held 24 bells (I-47) | $2.5k–6.8k; 24 bells ≈ $59k–163k | one province (delay) |
| ClashInputs (GatherClash, RFI, SettleTransit) | D, 0.5 | that resolution waits | $2.5k–6.8k | one province-bell (delay) |
| BellAnchor, SeedCache nonce | D, 0.5 | windows stay open longer; seed later; keepers switch nonce | $2.5k–6.8k | one region (delay) |
| Frontier (OpenRing, FoldOccupancy) | D, 0.5 | ring openings and folds wait; Join uses the last fold (capacity may tighten) | $2.5k–6.8k | world-wide ring growth (delay) |
| ProvinceFund(w) (OpenProvince, CloseProvince) | D, 0.5 | openings in that wedge wait | $2.5k–6.8k | one wedge (delay) |
| RingSeed(d) (ConsumeRingSeed, OpenProvince) | D, 0.5 | ring d's seed and provinces wait | $2.5k–6.8k | one ring (delay) |
| JoinShard (Join P, SettleTicket D, ReleaseDormant N) | P / D 0.5 | joins hashed there wait; ticket settlement waits | player writes ≈ free (priority 0, as DESIGN accepts); SettleTicket $2.5k–6.8k | 1/8 of one faction's joins |
| Citizen, Holding (player P; SettleTicket, SettleDeparture, SettleTransit D) | P / D 0.5 | that player waits | P ≈ free; D $2.5k–6.8k | one player |
| DefencePool (ClaimDefence D; SweepPoolOwed, dormancy, closes N) | D 0.5 / N | claims and sweeps wait; claims expire after the 6-bell grace | $2.5k–6.8k per 10 min, ≈ $15k–41k to void one grace | refunds of one bell-region |
| *Any address, by pre-funding* | — | nothing (§4.2) | — | none |

No W or D instruction except ClaimDefence writes the DefencePool, and none writes a world-wide counter other than Frontier (class D, priced above); v1.0's `[dpool w]` in every SettleTransit (a world-wide settlement stall for one account's price at a fixed low bid) is gone.

## 9. Web data contracts

### 9.1 Client state and storage

| Key (localStorage) | Content | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ps-lang` | `ja` / `en` | shared with v9, unchanged |
| `ps-fsession:<cluster>:<program>:<season>:<wallet>` | session key seed (v9 backup format) | domain `PS/frontier-session/v1`; checked against `Citizen.session` |
| `ps-fmarch:<cluster>:<program>:<season>:<wallet>` | marchbook JSON array | written **before** Depart is signed |
| `ps-fui:<cluster>:<program>:<season>` | UI prefs (fog switch, LOD, dismissed onboarding) | convenience only |

Marchbook entry (v1): `{v:1, host:"u64 dec", transitSlot, departBell, arriveBell, plain_b64, salt_b64, commit_hex, sealRoot_hex, round, tip, state:"sealed|sent|landed|revealing|revealed|settled|failed", attempts:[{t, route:"self|keeper", result}]}`. **`k` and `sigma` are never stored.** Self-reveal: at `bell_start(arrive)` + 0–20 s random, `POST /gw/f/reveal` once; again only if the slot is absent after 60 s and the window is open; never before the arrival bell starts.

**Frontier session text** (`web/frontier/fsession.mjs`, pinned byte for byte by `web-frontier-session.test.mjs`, never translated):
```
Wylls wants you to create an in-game key.
Site: <origin>
Cluster: <cluster>
Program: <program id>
Season: <season id>
Anyone holding this key can act as you in this season (build, train, march, explore). It cannot move tokens from your wallet.
Sign only on <host>.
```

### 9.2 Herald JSON envelope (province, me, clash)

```json
{"v":1,"key":"pv:<P>,<Q>","bell":<b>,"slot":<s>,"seq":"<u64 dec>","head":"<hex32>","bytes":"<base64>",
 "slots":[{"key":"ar:<P>,<Q>,<b>,<f>,<i>","slot":<s>,"bytes":"<base64>"}],
 "day":{"key":"ad:<P>,<Q>,<day>","bytes":"<base64>"}|null,
 "inputs":{"key":"ci:<P>,<Q>,<b>","seq":"…","head":"…","bytes":"<base64>"}|null}
```
The client decodes `bytes` with the generated codec and ignores every decoded convenience field for anything it signs or verifies.

### 9.3 Overview binary (`/h/overview/{ring}/{bell}.bin`)

Header 32 B: `magic "PSFOV1\0\0"` · season u64 · ring u16 · n u16 · bell u32 · slot u64. Then `n` records × 24 B, sorted by (P, Q): `P i16 · Q i16 · owners 40 bits (12 × 3-bit faction: 0–5, 6 neutral/camp, 7 none) · site_state 24 bits (12 × 2: free, holding, camp, reserved/released) · hosts_by_faction [7] u8 (saturating) · flags u8 (1 clash this bell, 2 any dormant holding, 4 province opened this bell) · resolved_next u32`.

### 9.4 Transaction shapes the client builds

| Instruction | Signers besides the relay fee payer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Join | **wallet** | the only wallet signature; session pubkey in the data |
| SetSession | wallet | |
| FileTicket, SetVigil, Harvest, Build, Train, Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Explore, Depart | session key | `payer` (account 1) = relay fee payer; priority 0; CU limit from `budgets.mjs` |
| Reveal | none — not a client transaction | `POST /gw/f/reveal` with material (I-24) |
| SettleTransit, SettleExplore | none (the relay fee payer is `payer`) | offered as buttons after their time; sent through `/gw/f/relay` as the settle shapes of §8.3 (charged to the requester's own quota); SettleTransit's data carries `commit` and `seal` from the DEPART log; keepers normally do them first, and a second attempt fails harmlessly |

Before signing, the client checks the message byte for byte (program id, accounts recomputed, no bump from anyone, the announced fee payer, recent blockhash); v1.3: `fchainio.messageProblems` requires the blockhash GET /f/relay gave and the Frontier instruction the page built from recomputed addresses (`expected`), compares the message's instruction to it account by account and byte for byte, requires the `payer` account to be the fee payer and runs the relay's own allowlist (`classify`); the seal's round is T(arrive_bell) of the season clock, never a caller's input (`sealMarch` refuses another, `WrongRound`); after the relay answers it fetches the landed transaction through the herald and compares. Depart ≤ 800 B asserted in `web-frontier-march.test.mjs`; the composer offers only the three tip presets (§8.3); FileTicket shows the refundable Holding-rent escrow; a displaced ticket offers a one-tap refile (I-47).

### 9.5 WASM exports (`frontier-wasm`, C ABI, borsh in/out over linear memory, `alloc`/`free`)

`ruleset_hash`, `province_of`, `province_centre`, `ring_of`, `wedge_of`, `region_of`, `generate_province(ring_seed, P, Q)`, `plan_path(start, dest, unit, blocked)`, `path_cost`, `earliest_arrival_bell`, `check_arrival_bell`, `bell_at`, `bell_start`, `tlock_round`, `seed_round`, `plaintext_pack`, `plaintext_unpack`, `plaintext_validate`, `commit`, `salt_of`, `body_xor`, `resolve_clash`, `resolve_from_inputs(ClashInputs bytes, seed)`, `reachable(origin, depart_bell, target_bell, unit)`, `accrual_at(Accrual, t)`. Build: `scripts/build-wasm.sh` (1.95.0, `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, `opt-level="s"`, `panic="abort"`, `--remap-path-prefix`), output `web/frontier/wasm/frontier.wasm` + `.sha256`; budget ≤ 400 KB raw / ≤ 150 KB gzip.

### 9.6 Program errors in the UI

`web/frontier/fi18n.mjs` maps every code of §5.4 to JA and EN text (generated table from `frontier-abi/vectors/errors.json`); `web-frontier-errors.test.mjs` fails on a missing code.

---

## 10. Operations constants

### 10.1 Fee and priority formulas (pinned; `fees` kernel, `fclient::fees`, `fees.mjs` share vectors)

```
cost      = cu_limit + 720·n_sig + 300·n_write_locks + 8·ceil(L / 32,768)
L(kind)   = round_up(programdata_len + 45 + Σ_accounts (data_len + 64), 32,768)      at the kind's worst account set (SIMD-0186, I-45)
            programdata_len = the deployed max_len; deploy with --max-len = round_up(1.25 × .so size, 4,096)
priority  = (priority_fee + 2,500) / cost                                                  (lamports per cost unit)
fee(p)    = max(0, p·cost − 2,500);  cu_price_µl = ceil(fee(p)·10⁶ / cu_limit)
p_tip     = (tip − 2,500) / cost_reveal
tip_min   = ceil(p_min × (reveal_cu_limit + 1,320 + 8·ceil(L_reveal / 32,768))) + 2,500
            (p_min = 0.433, L_reveal = 1 MiB until measured: 14,441 at 26k, 10,111 at 16k)
```

v1.0 pinned `L = 65,536` (+16) from SP-FEE, whose probe program is 13,600 B; SP-V2's program is already 480,512–540,608 B [measured], and SIMD-0186 counts the programdata, so every M1 transaction would have failed and still paid its fee. v1.0's "10,006 at 16k" also rounded down (integer ceil gives 10,007). The C4 priorities move by < 1% (cost +240 per Reveal).

### 10.2 Budgets table

`frontier-abi/src/budgets.rs` holds, per instruction kind: CU budget (§5.5), CU limit to request (= measured max + 5%, rounded up to 500; v1.9: never more than 5 % of the budget above it — the budget bounds what an instruction uses, the limit is what a client requests; only the keeper's retry ladder goes further, I-50), loaded-data limit `L(kind)` (§10.1, from the release `.so` and its max_len), tx byte ceiling, heap ceiling (28,672 B at gated fills; allocator ceiling 262,144 B), lock ceiling. Generated to `frontier-abi/vectors/budgets.json` → `budgets.mjs`. The wave-5 gate regenerates the CU limits from the G1 measurements and `L(kind)` from the release `.so`; every earlier gate regenerates `L(kind)` from the current build. **v1.12:** a limit is measured over **every** path the keeper sends: CloseArrivalDay and CloseArrivalSlot are measured on the Running season, Ended < 72 h, Ended ≥ 72 h and the Closed tombstone, each with a pre-funded and a never-created account (svm-tests `g01_close_arrival_day_ended_paths`, `g01_close_arrival_slot_ended_paths`), and request the §5.5 budget, **8,000**, which the worst measured path (CloseArrivalDay 6,018, CloseArrivalSlot 6,538 transaction CU with the keeper's three-instruction prefix and a distinct `rent_to`) stays under by ≥ 5 %; `w6-s7`'s limits (6,000 / 6,500: the Running path + 5 %) failed every Ended-path close (28,655 failed transactions in the drain).

### 10.3 Ports (none on the reserved list 4185, 4190, 4191, 4194, 18899, 17799, 28899, 27799, 26699, 5185, 5191)

Tests and fixture servers bind `127.0.0.1:0`. `frontier-stack` refuses to start if a configured port is reserved, outside 41000–41999, or already bound (`lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`).

## 11. Implementation units and file ownership

Rules: a unit owns exactly the paths listed for its wave (globs are recursive); every other path is read-only for it. Paths not listed anywhere in a wave are frozen during that wave, except for the integrator's files and integration window (§3.4, I-55): **the integrator owns every dependency section of every `Cargo.toml`, every `Cargo.lock`, every `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, every `rust-toolchain.toml` and `.gitignore`**, and units request changes to them in their notes. `frontier-abi/src/layout/**` is **frozen after wave 1** and `permutation-frontier/src/layout/**` after wave 2 (changes only by contract amendment, §16). Files created as stubs by one unit and "handed over" belong to the named later unit from its wave on. Within a wave, units that depend on another unit's new API code against the signatures pinned in §5–§9; the integrator merges in the listed order. Each unit writes `docs/frontier/m1/<unit-id>-NOTES.md` (what landed, measurements, deviations, dependency requests). Dates assume a start on Monday 2026-09-28.

### Wave 1 — Foundations and the M0 closeout (weeks 1–1.5, 2026-09-28 → 10-07). Merge order: W1-B, W1-A, W1-C, W1-E, W1-F, W1-D

## 12. Wave gates (exact commands)

Common preamble (run from the integration worktree root `$R`, on `frontier/m1-integ` after merging the wave). **v1.1 (I-26): the gate checks only the ports M1 binds; it never requires the reserved ports to be idle** (the owner's own services listen on 4185, 4191 and 4194, and no M1 process ever binds a reserved port):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
cd "$R"
RESERVED=" 4185 4190 4191 4194 18899 17799 28899 27799 26699 5185 5191 "
for p in ${M1_PORTS:-}; do          # empty for gates W1–W4: their tests bind 127.0.0.1:0
  case "$RESERVED" in *" $p "*) echo "M1 port $p is reserved: fix the config"; exit 1;; esac
  { [ "$p" -ge 41000 ] && [ "$p" -le 41999 ]; } || { echo "M1 port $p is outside 41000-41999"; exit 1; }
  if lsof -nP -iTCP:"$p" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "M1 port $p is busy"; exit 1; fi
done
PENDING_OWNER=""                    # items blocked by an unapproved install or download (O-M1-12); listed in the gate report
pending() { PENDING_OWNER="$PENDING_OWNER $1"; echo "PENDING-OWNER: $1"; }
```
From gate W5 on, `frontier-stack check-ports --config <cfg>` applies the same rule to every port a stack config names. A `PENDING-OWNER` item is neither a pass nor a silent skip: the gate report lists it, and the wave that first needs it (W6 for real rounds, W7 for the exit) cannot pass while it is pending.

**Gate W1** (all must exit 0):
```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked -p permutation-rules -p frontier-abi --all-targets -- -D warnings

Pass: the run completes (fixes allowed, one re-run from snapshot allowed); verify PASS; tamper all FAIL; the latency run meets criterion 3's game-second targets; the c4 v3 report cites the measured Reveal CU distribution and `L(reveal)`; scripted onboarding run green in JA and EN. The gate cannot pass with "real rounds" pending. **v1.10 notes (integ-W6):** (a) `up` drains at `max(scale, 20)` by default (W6-A), so the latency line's drain runs at 20×; latencies are judged over play only; (b) the `w6-s7` line is run by `scripts/m1-run-s7.sh` (W6-A): the line as written plus `--expect-so-sha256 <release build record>` (the run refuses another `.so`; V2 checks the pin); the line names no `--adversary` — pass `--adversary` to the script for the §13.4 hold schedule (`configs/w6-s7.toml` has it on); the services stay up for triage unless `--down`; (c) the scripted onboarding line is `permutation-gateway/screens/live/run-onboarding.sh` (W6-D; base 41000, herald 41040; `--spectator` adds §13.6's 24-game-hour memory check **and runs the stack for 2 game days** — v1.11: the two onboarding runs take ≈ 23 bells at 20× and the spectator needs 144 more before the chain pauses at the end of play + drain, which a 1-day stack reaches at bell 170); (d) criterion 3's readings are the pinned ones of §13.4 (F5, S → resolve). **v1.12 notes (the `w6-s7` triage):** (e) `frontier-stack up --season-end-at-play-end` (config `season_end_at_play_end = true`) creates the season with `end_bell` = the play bells and `join_close_bell` scaled below it, so a 1- or 2-day run reaches `end_bell`, EndSeason and the drain; after CreateSeason the stack re-checks the archive against the actual `genesis_ts + (end_bell + drain bells) × 600 + 3,600` and fails early; (f) `--chaos-force herald:<game hours after the viewer start>` (repeatable) forces a herald kill inside the viewer window; (g) the viewer generator gets `--retry-budget-ms` (= the chaos restart maximum / scale × 1,000 + 2,000), `--think-ms`, `--follow-status <herald url>`, `--provinces` (the opened provinces) and `--rings` (all rings) from `frontier-stack` (`configs/w6-s7.toml`, `configs/m1-exit.toml`); (h) the adversary arms `slots-below` and `lag` over the whole play window (like `ticket`), `lag` takes its origin from a transit in flight (state 1–2), and `slots-below` goes no later than 60 % of play so that `defence-pool` has a claim to hold; **any §13.4 hold reported `hold-skipped` makes the run not exit-grade** (the report says so); (i) keeper B runs with `backup_delay_slots = 8`; (j) the `w6-s7` re-run uses a new run id (`w6-s7b`), the same archive and G0 (a new G0 would need a new archive download, not approved), the release `.so` of §3.2 v1.12, and the tamper line expects 30 classes judged, 23 required.

**Gate W7 = the M1 exit**: §13 in full on the final commit (release `.so`, real rounds), then the exit report.

---

## 13. M1 exit test plan

Everything runs on the **release SBPF v2 `.so`** built by `scripts/build-frontier.sh` (hash recorded), except CU tracing builds, which only add `trace` markers (the gate compares plain-build CU; trace builds report heap).

### 13.1 E1 — SBF budgets with adversarial fill (G1)

For each instruction: its ceiling from §5.5, heap ≤ 28 KiB, tx ≤ its byte ceiling and ≤ 1,232 B, locks ≤ 64, **at the named worst case**:

| Instruction(s) | Adversarial fill |
|---|---|
| ResolveFromInputs | SP-V2's 40 hand-built fills + **all 1,200** fills of the native screen (v1.1; not the top 24), with the full M1 write-back, on the full-gather path; 48 residents, 24 arrivals, all hexes contested, asymmetric doctrines; **plus the storage fill (I-43): 40 residents, 8 pending musters of one faction, 1–8 departed entries awaiting SettleDeparture, 24 arrivals that would all stay** — entries after the resolve ≤ 56 and ≤ 8 per faction after the musters join |
| GatherClash | 24 positions with 10 Holdings (≤ 3 parts), mixed present/absent/pre-funded |
| Reveal | 32 steps over 4 provinces, displacement of the smallest of 4 full slots, first reveal of the province-bell (ArrivalDay init on a pre-funded address), anchor present and BeaconLog read |
| SkipQuiet | 24 bells, 48 residents with pending ops at every bell (quiet test recomputed every bell), 2 ArrivalDays, 24 anchor keys: the CU-aware stop commits a prefix within the limit; budget `60k + 30k × recomputed bells` (I-50) |
| SettleTransit | every outcome branch with the seal opener; the worst is a bad seal (code 1, FO failure after the pairing) on a Stays host settled after archive (archive `sig` path), and a bounce-by-rank against a full final set with a drained recipient (divert to `pool_owed`) |
| SettleTransit seal codes | each code 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 (was ProveBadSeal, I-44); code 3 is reserved and never emitted (v1.3: a wrong-round seal is code 1) |
| FileTicket, SettleTicket | 3 sites in 3 provinces with full cohort tables; SettleTicket displacement with the displaced rent payer, Citizen and JoinShard and 3 ticket provinces |
| every instruction | `g01_loaded_limit_<kind>`: its worst account set with `L(kind)` against the release `.so` passes, one page less fails (I-45) |
| PostAnchor, PostAnchorMulti, PostSeed, PostBeacon, ConsumeGenesisSeed, ConsumeRingSeed | 32 real quicknet beacons (worst hint path) |
| OpenProvince | the worst of ring 2..10 × 6 wedges (most sites, 2 camps) |
| SettleTicket (lottery) | see the FileTicket row |
| Join | 1,000 seeded wallets (CL-28) + an adversarial wallet with a long hash path |
| Depart, Muster, Build, Train, Explore, SettleExplore, SettleDeparture | full queue, 48-entry Province, max resources |
| ArchiveAnchors | 8 bells with 8 anchor closes and a fresh archive |
| ClaimDefence | 6 slots, caps binding |
| all others | their maximal account lists |

### 13.2 E2/E3 — Pre-funding and forgery (G2, G3)

- **Pre-funding, per creation path** (pre-fund the canonical address with rent and 10× rent, then create successfully; the payer pays only the shortfall; a stand-alone probe shows `CreateAccount` failing on the same address): Season (AnnounceSeason), Frontier, ProvinceFund ×6, DefencePool (CreateSeason), BeaconLog (InitBeaconLogs), JoinShard (InitShards), RingSeed (OpenRing, both paths), Province (OpenProvince, funded path), Citizen (Join), Holding (SettleTicket fresh), ArrivalSlot (Reveal), ArrivalDay (Reveal), ClashInputs (GatherClash), BellAnchor (PostAnchor and PostAnchorMulti), SeedCache (PostSeed), AnchorArchive (ArchiveAnchors), DefenceClaim (ClaimDefence) — **17 account kinds over 19 creation paths** (RingSeed and BellAnchor each have two; v1.1 removed SealVerdict). Plus: a pre-funded never-created ArrivalSlot and ArrivalDay count as absent at gather, skip and settle.
- **Re-creation, per closable kind (I-46):** after its close, the creating instruction is refused for ClashInputs (GatherClash `LatchClosed`, also for a skipped bell), ArrivalSlot and ArrivalDay (latch), BellAnchor and SeedCache (tombstone), Province, RingSeed, Holding and Citizen (season status or ticket rules), AnchorArchive (season status).
- **Forgery, per keyed account** (each refused with the pinned code): wrong address (`BadAddress`), wrong owner, wrong magic, wrong season, wrong key fields (`BadAccount`), absence claimed at a non-canonical address (`BadAddress`), for every account kind any instruction reads or writes; a forged anchor/cache/archive/inputs/ArrivalDay in every instruction that reads one.

### 13.3 E4 — Property tests (program level, LiteSVM)

| Gate | Property |
|---|---|
| G4 | No Reveal lands at `now ≥ A + W`, once the BeaconLog holds a round ≥ S, after the first gather (latch), or for a tombstoned bell — over random A, Clock, window schedules and supplied/omitted/forged anchors and archives |
| G5 | One anchor per (bell, region); every cache nonce gives the same seed; no second anchor after archive; ResolveFromInputs refuses a cache whose A differs from THE anchor's |
| G6 | A gather that omits a present slot cannot complete; a clear ArrivalDay bit gathers in one step |
| G7 | **Lag invariance:** hold the origin Province, the origin region's anchor and SettleDeparture past the destination's close → the destination's result is byte-identical to the unheld run |
| G8 | Gathers in random order and with repeats + ResolveFromInputs == ResolveClash (oracle build) == native kernel digest; **the I-43 storage fill never exceeds 56 entries or 8 per faction after musters join** |
| G9 | Quota fairness: 8 reveal orders × random arrivals → the same final slots = `quota_set`; SettleTransit outcomes (admitted/bounced/routed) identical across orders |
| G10 | SettleTransit's seal code = stock `tlock` decryption + commitment + `Plain::validate` for valid, garbage, tampered U/V/W, wrong round, invalid plaintext, logged-vs-committed mismatch, forged commitment — **before and after ArchiveAnchors** (I-44) |
| G11 | SkipQuiet over a run == gathering and resolving each bell (byte-identical Province), for random rosters with and without pending ops, **including rosters changed at every bell (the CU-aware stop commits prefixes whose sum equals the resolves)** |
| G12 | Every SettleTransit branch incl. **settle races proof** (a garbage seal revealed in-bell, settled at the earliest instant: destroyed), **a Stays host that tries to re-depart, dissolve or explore before its settlement** (`HostInTransit`), bad seal after archive, closed or never-resolved inputs, stranded hosts, drained recipients (`pool_owed`), **claim after settle** (slot kept for the grace) and **claim after displacement** (reset); a ticket cohort's Province held through `round_time(S) + 600` (the higher score still wins; finality waits) |
| G13 | One test per (instruction, error code); `RELEASE_CHECK=1` passes (no PENDING, no `NotImplemented`) |
| G14 | 100 bots × 2 game days in LiteSVM through the program with the native kernel re-run every bell (test key); verifier PASS; one tampered log → FAIL (owner: W5-C) |

### 13.4 E5 — The 7-day accelerated local season (Mode A)

```
Environment: `frontier-localnet` with the pinned release `.so` (deployed with its `--max-len`), `drand-replay` with real historical quicknet rounds (**≈ 250k contiguous rounds**, I-53), relay, keeper A (operator roles) and keeper B (public profile) each with ≥ 150 reveal payers, ≥ 32 delay payers and ≥ 4 funders, herald, 1,000 bots with the thirteen personas, adversary schedule (hold one province's slots through a close below and above the keeper cap; hold one region's anchor; hold 20 known keeper payers; hold the origin Province and origin anchor past a destination's close; **hold a ticket cohort's Province through `final_ts`; hold Frontier and one ProvinceFund during a ring opening; hold the DefencePool through part of a claim grace**), chaos (`kill -9` a random component every 2–6 game hours, restart after 0–60 game seconds). **v1.12: every hold must fire; a hold the report lists as `hold-skipped` makes the run not exit-grade.** **v1.13:** `slots-below` is priced at **1,900** (was 1,500; still below the keepers' cap 2,000, above their third Reveal bid 1,732), so the Reveal it delays lands on the keepers' fourth version, ≥ `lateness_slots` (4) after the anchor, and opens the defence claim `defence-pool` holds; while `defence-pool` waits for a claim, a `slots-below` window that opened none is re-armed a bell after it ends on a bell the fleet sealed a march to (the marchbook; at most 12 times, while a window, a claim and the defence hold still fit before the end of play); a re-armed hold that finds nothing is `hold-rearm-expired`, not `hold-skipped`. All ports in 41000–41999. Slots are 400 ms real, 8 game seconds each (I-54). Wall time ≈ 8.4 h + ≈ 1 min of pre-season at scale 2,000. **Pass criteria:**
1. The season reaches `end_bell`, EndSeason lands, and within 2 game hours after the end: zero province-bells stuck (every opened province resolved or skipped through `end_bell − 1`), zero transits in state 1–2 older than `close + 2 bells`, zero transits unsettled, every ClashInputs closable after grace.
2. Max CU per instruction kind observed in play ≤ its §5.5 budget; the full **Reveal CU distribution** (p50/p99/max) reported.
3. Keeper latencies at 20×, **in slots** (I-54): round → anchor p99 ≤ 2 slots; S → first cache p99 ≤ 2 slots; T(b) anchor → last valid reveal p99 ≤ 4 slots; close → resolve p99 ≤ 8 slots for active provinces; catch-up ≤ 6 SkipQuiet txs per idle province-day whose roster did not change (churned provinces reported). The game-second targets (round → anchor ≤ 5 s, S → cache ≤ 5 s, anchor → last reveal ≤ 30 s, close → resolve ≤ 60 s, all p99) are checked in W6's scale-2 latency run. **Reference points (v1.10; W5-B F5 pinned by W6-A, extended by integ-W6):** a round is *public* at `round_time(r) + drand delay`; **round → anchor and S → first cache count from the first slot whose Clock shows the round public to the landing slot** (the slot targets) and, in game seconds, from the publication instant (the 2× targets); anchor → last valid reveal from THE anchor's `A`; **close → resolve is judged as S → resolve**: from `S(b, r) = first_round_from(close + Δ)` public (`Δ = seed_margin ≥ 60`, §5.1: no ResolveFromInputs can land before the seed round exists, so a reading from `close = A + W` is ≥ Δ + delay by construction; both readings are reported, the target applies to S → resolve). **(A1, v1.12)** An idle province-day is one whose Province `roster_epoch` did not move **and** that had no GATHER or CLASH for that province that day (post-states and records); a SkipQuiet's own change counts for its first bell's day. (A day with arrivals needs at least `resolves + 1` SkipQuiet, so no keeper can meet 6 on it; it is reported with the churned days. The slot targets are not amended.) **(A1 as amended, v1.13)** An idle province-day also had **no resident action and no nudge** of that province on that day or in the 26 bells before it (the batch a nudge can cut): no Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Explore or Depart transaction naming the Province, landed or refused, and no nudge a keeper took (`/v1/status` `play.nudges_recent`, sampled once a bell). Such days are reported as **resident** (each nudge costs one SkipQuiet split by design: the province is caught up at once so the player may act). The SkipQuiet that reaches `end_bell` (`b0 + n ≥ end_bell`, the season-end flush) is not counted.
4. Liveness: `ValidSealUnrevealed` = 0 outside the adversary-held windows where the hold was above the keeper cap (those are listed and expected); `min_tip` persona fully revealed by keepers; **the reveal pool's effective N ≥ 150 in every bell** (I-49). **(A2, v1.12)** A valid seal whose Reveal the program refuses by rule (§5.11 step 6: `Shielded`, `Path`, `ArrivalBell`; judged by V5 from the post-states and the plaintext, not from error codes, §8.5) is `unrevealed_by_rule` with its reason and is not a liveness miss; the report prints `unrevealed_by_rule` by reason. **Any such refusal of an `honest` persona march is a criterion-5 violation.**
5. Every persona's expected outcome observed (§8.6). **(v1.13)** The report passes 5 only when no persona is violated, no honest march was refused by rule (A2), and every persona is `observed` or, when only the chain can judge it, **exercised** (a landed Depart for min_tip, garbage_seal, bad_plaintext, squatter and self_tip; two for double_arrival; a prefund; a ticket or hold); a persona still `pending`, never exercised, or refused with a code its rule does not name leaves 5 **n.a.** (not passed). The fleet's report of every lifetime counts (a restarted `frontier-bots` keeps the earlier `report-life-<n>.json`).
6. Herald: p99 file latency ≤ 250 ms, ingest → WS p99 ≤ 2 s, error rate < 0.1% at 5,000 viewers (4,000 polling, 1,000 WS) for 24 game hours. **(A3, v1.12)** An **error** is a request that fails after the client's standard recovery: one retry of an idempotent GET on a stale keep-alive connection, and a connect or WS reconnect within a budget of the chaos restart maximum / scale + 2 s. Outages inside chaos kill windows are reported (`unavailable`, `unavailable_ms`, `ws.reconnects`, the outage windows) and are not errors; a herald not back within the budget fails; stale retries or WS reconnects outside the kill windows are flagged. WS viewers must be connected ≥ 99 % of the window outside the outage windows. The error rate is `(errors + ws.errors) / (requests + ws sessions)`. The load follows the live bell over the opened provinces and all rings.
7. Bots' outcome statistics within an order of magnitude of `frontier-sim` for the same agents (clashes per bell, returns by archetype) — reported, not gating.
8. **Bad seals (I-44):** verifier `BadSealSurvived` = 0; every `garbage_seal`, `bad_plaintext` and `settle_racer` transit settled as bad-seal with the stock opener's code. **(v1.13)** The transits are the bots' marchbook `sealed` lines of kind `garbage` or `bad_plaintext` whose Depart was sent (not failed) and that are due (`arrive + 3 ≤` the last bell): each must have settled `BAD_SEAL` with a nonzero code (5 for bad plaintext); with no due transit of either kind, 8 is **n.a.** (not exercised), not passed.
9. **Tickets (I-47):** every cohort closed within 24 bells; the `ticket_holder` persona never keeps a site it did not win.

**Report additions (v1.12, reported, not gating):** criterion 1's `due` rule is unchanged (a transit is due when `arrive + 3 ≤` the last bell), so a regression of the Depart bound shows up again; the failed transactions are classed per (kind, code) as expected, redundancy or waste; the keeper status uses the last non-null `/v1/status` sample and its `duties.*` fields and counts null samples as keeper-status timeouts; the load average is printed per bell; a window of ≥ 20 slots with no landed or failed transaction is detected from the verify input and listed; the bots' never-revealed marches (`bots/report.json.unrevealed[]`) are listed with their last refusal code.

### 13.5 E6 — Verifier

`frontier-verify` over the exit season's RPC and archive: **PASS** (exit 0) in < 10 min on 8 threads; the tamper suite on a copy of the run: **all 23 required classes FAIL** with their named codes (T1–T22 and, v1.12, T24; the 7 extra classes are judged too: 30 in all); each `mutate-<check>` build lets its own tamper PASS (checks of the checks); honest-but-adverse fixtures PASS.

### 13.6 E7 — Web smoke

- `(cd permutation-gateway && npm test)`: every `web-frontier-*` test, the existing v9 web tests unchanged, `web-lang` completeness over `web/frontier/**`, `web-sdk` freshness incl. `sdk/frontier` and the noble manifest, `web-frontier-wasm` hash.
- Screenshot suite: 10 screens (join/faction, site picker, map world LOD, map tile LOD with fog, holding, march composer, march tracker, bell sheet, clash report, practice result) + onboarding card + spectator × JA/EN × 360×740, 390×844, 1440×900: no console errors or failed requests, no horizontal overflow, landmarks and bell chip visible, interactive elements ≥ 44 × 44 px at phone widths, axe no serious/critical, no Japanese glyphs in EN except names; language toggle re-renders without reload. Pixel diffs advisory.
- Scripted onboarding on the exit stack (Playwright + dev wallet, 390 px, JA and EN): join → site → build → scout/explore → sealed march on a camp → report → verify-in-browser green.
- Spectator open 24 game hours: memory growth ≤ 200 MB.

### 13.7 E8 — Measurements owed to M0

The full Reveal CU (worst and in-play distribution) and `L(reveal)` from the release `.so` (I-45) → c4 model v3 (CL-26/30) → the default tip priority and `tip_min` final; the quiet-bell proof's cost per idle province-day (and per churned province-day, I-50); the per-bell reveal count R99 and the payer pools' effective N (I-49); ResolveFromInputs worst CU and heap after Phase A (and B if adopted); the arrival-slot tie-break at Reveal time (kernel `slot_key`).

### 13.8 After the exit

Only with the owner's explicit approval: a private devnet playtest, 50–200 people, no money (config and runbook from W5-E; invites; relay 40/20 quotas; herald and relay hosting decided then). Every devnet step and every push needs its own approval.

## 14. Estimate (honest, v1.1)

| Wave | Calendar | Units | Unit engineer-weeks [estimate] | Main uncertainty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 foundations + closeout | 1.5 wk | 6 | 9.0 | CL-09/CL-10/I-43 outcome changes → doctrine re-tune (+1–5 days); root-lock resolution for arkworks |
| W2 program core, harness, localnet, relay, web foundation, keeper beacons | 1.5 wk | 6 | 9.5 | the validator drill (loaded-data accounting); test-key tlock interop |
| W3 land, holdings, Reveal, keeper land, herald, bots, web play | 2 wk | 6 | 11.5 | Reveal > 26k (the two cuts, +2–3 days); cohort edge cases |
| W4 clash, transit, keeper play, verifier, web report, integration | 2 wk | 6 | 11.5 | SettleTransit with the proof inside; the first system run |
| W5 hardening | 1.5 wk | 5 | 7.0 | coverage table (49 instructions × their codes); herald load numbers |
| W6 runs and fixes | 2 wk | 5 | 7.0 | each failed 8.4-h run ≈ 1 day; archive download timing |
| W7 exit | 1.5 wk | 3 | 3.0 | re-runs after late fixes |
| Integrator (merges, manifests and locks, gates, 7 integration windows of ≤ 2 days) | 12 wk | 1 | 4.0 | gate wall time (below) |
| **Total** | **12 weeks nominal** | — | **≈ 62.5 (58.5 units + 4 integrator)** | — |

- **Range:** ≈ 50% by 12.5 weeks (≈ 2026-12-24) and ≈ 80% by 14.5 weeks (≈ 2027-01-07). The calendar crosses the year end; count real availability. v1.0's "10 weeks, ≈ 45 (§0) / ≈ 47 (§14) engineer-weeks" is withdrawn: the two figures disagreed (the §14 rows sum to 47), and neither counted integration, gate wall time or owner-approval latency. Capacity check: six implementers × 12 weeks = 72 ew, so 58.5 unit ew is ≈ 81% utilisation.
- **Gate wall time** (inside the integration windows): W1 ≈ 3 h + the overnight doctrine run; W2 ≈ 3.5 h; W3 ≈ 4 h; W4 ≈ 5 h (full svm-tests, in-process day, tamper fixtures); W5 ≈ 8 h (22 mutate builds ≈ 2 h, the 14.4-min smoke, the 5,000-viewer load); W6 three nights + the 3-h latency run + ≤ 3 × 8.4-h runs; W7 ≈ 9 h per exit attempt (8.4 h + verification), planned twice.
- **Owner-approval latency:** O-M1-12 is asked on day 1 (2026-09-28). The wasm32 target is needed by 2026-10-07, Playwright Chromium by 2026-11-16, the round archive by 2026-11-25 (≈ 1.2 h to fetch). Until then the items are `PENDING-OWNER` and nothing else waits on them (the test key covers every in-process gate). If the archive is approved after 2026-12-01, the exit slips day for day. The 50% figure carries 0.5 week of slack for this.
- **N5:** the M0 closeout lands with wave 1 at week 1.5 (2026-10-07), not in week 1; the overnight doctrine re-runs may finish in week 2.
- **DESIGN schedule:** DESIGN planned M1 in design weeks 7–15. At 12 weeks M1 ends around design week 19, so M2 (weeks 13–19) must overlap or later milestones slip ≈ 4 weeks.
- **What would cut time (in this order):** ClaimDefence to M2 (−1.0 ew, removes the claim grace and DefenceClaim; I-22's first cut); herald WS (polling only, −1 ew); the screenshot matrix to phone + desktop (−0.5 ew); the practice what-if (−0.5 ew); Mode R is already optional. With all four cuts: ≈ 11 weeks nominal. **What must not be cut:** the gates of §13.1–§13.5, the verifier's tamper suite, the lag gate, the pre-funding, forgery and re-creation tests, the seal proof in settlement (I-44) and the storage room (I-43).
- **Tools cost:** each 7-day run is ≈ 8.4 h wall time plus ≈ 10 min verification; plan for 3 attempts in W6 and 2 in W7.

## 15. Owner decisions needed (working defaults in force until decided)

| # | Question | Working default (implementers build to it) | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-M1-01 | Accept with-seed addresses for player accounts (I-01, program D2) | yes | W1-E layout freeze |
| O-M1-02 | Accept ArrivalDay + SkipQuiet as the quiet-bell proof (I-10, D3) | yes | W1-E, W3-B, W4-A |
| O-M1-03 | Accept SettleDeparture + Holding-based gathers (I-11, D4), rank-based transit outcomes (I-12, D5), ResolveFromInputs writing ClashInputs (I-13, D6) | yes | W3-B, W4-A, W4-B |
| O-M1-04 | Clash Phase B (a rules change: one hash per engagement) before the exit if the gates re-pass (I-14) | decide at the W5 gate on the measured gates | W5-A |
| O-M1-05 | No postures in M1 (I-16; DESIGN §12 lists them) | no postures | W1-E |
| O-M1-06 | Minimum tip in priority terms, zero tip removed (I-08) | yes, p_min 0.433 | W3-B, W3-F |
| O-M1-07 | AnnounceSeason ≥ 24 h ahead, single-use ids, 1 SOL creation bond burned on a post-round pre-join abort (I-09, CL-24); v1.1: only the program's upgrade authority may announce (I-51) | in M1 | W1-E, W2-A |
| O-M1-08 | D18 re-size: W/D class split, pool pays Reveal only, pool 20 SOL if it covers ≥ 100 p99 bells (I-21, CL-30/31a); ClaimDefence in M1 as class D with a 6-bell claim grace (I-22, I-52) | yes / yes | W4-B, W4-C |
| O-M1-09 | Keeper start bid at the tip level (I-23) | p_start = p_tip, `--peace-start` off | W2-F |
| O-M1-10 | Mode A accelerated LiteSVM-backed run as the "7-day local season" exit (I-25), with real 400-ms slots and 8 game seconds per slot at 20× (I-54); Mode R 24-h soak as a complement | Mode A; Mode R only if O-M1-12 approves the install | W5-B, W6-A, W7-A |
| O-M1-11 | Depart charges the maximum march stamina (I-32) | yes | W3-B |
| O-M1-12 | Approve downloads and installs — **asked on 2026-09-28 (wave 1, day 1)** (I-53): (1) `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.95.0`, needed by **2026-10-07** (W2-E size gate); (2) Playwright Chromium if the cache is absent, by **2026-11-16** (W5 screens); (3) a **contiguous archive of ≈ 250,000 historical quicknet rounds** (read-only public data, ≈ 40 MB, ≈ 1.2 h at ≤ 20 requests/s per endpoint over 3 public endpoints, verified as fetched), by **2026-11-25** (W6 real-round runs; the exit cannot run without it); (4) Agave ≥ 4.0 for Mode R, optional. The installed `solana-test-validator 3.1.9` covers the I-45 drill without an install | none approved yet; until then the items are `PENDING-OWNER` and every in-process gate, nightly and rehearsal runs on the `test-beacon` build | W2-E, W5, W6, W7 |
| O-M1-13 | Ticket finality by cohort (I-47, replacing I-19's `round_time(S) + 600` alone) and the restated onboarding times (first holding 11–21 min, first clash report 31–41 min) in DESIGN §2.2/§2.3 (I-33) | yes | W1-D text, W3-F copy |
| O-M1-14 | Doctrine C display name "Flame" (I-34); fog with a "show everything" switch (I-35) | yes / yes | W3-F |
| O-M1-15 | Holding 1,280 B (I-31); v1.1 Citizen 384 B for the ticket escrow (per-player rent 9,753,600 lamports) | yes | W1-E |
| O-M1-16 | Carried from the closeout: D22 stake ramp (decide on the D23-on re-run), D24 Relic Sites, the Season-1 sweep target (CL-17), D23 details (caretaker term not counted; vacant seats allowed) | as closeout §7 | M2/M3 (not M1) |
| O-M1-17 | CL-35: fix the two legacy `civilization` tests (option a) — and, separately, a push approval when the owner wants GitHub CI to run | fix locally; no push | W1-D |
| O-M1-18 | After the exit: the private devnet playtest (50–200 people, no money), sponsorship values (40/20), invites, and hosting for the herald and relay | not approved | post-M1 |
| O-M1-19 | Settlement is the seal proof: SettleTransit opens and judges every seal (also after archive); ProveBadSeal and SealVerdict are removed; a host in an unsettled transit cannot Depart, Dissolve or Explore (I-44; DESIGN §6.2 names ProveBadSeal) | yes | W2-A, W3-B, W4-B |
| O-M1-20 | Ticket cohorts: finality waits for the cohort (≤ 24 bells), displacement has no time condition inside it, SettleTicket is class D, a displaced ticket ends and the player refiles (I-47) | yes | W3-A, W3-C, W3-F |
| O-M1-21 | Storage-aware clash room: arrivals beyond the room left by pending musters and departed entries bounce without loss (an outcome change only when such entries exist; the doctrine proxy gate is re-run in wave 1) (I-43) | yes | W1-A |
| O-M1-22 | Camps, exploration and training as the simulator models them: one camp per province on a non-site tile with daily respawn, plus an initial camp for onboarding; Train immediate; the explore floor gives Works only (DESIGN §2.3's goods floor waits) (I-56) | yes | W1-C, W1-D, W3-F |
| O-M1-23 | Playtest policy: invites enforced on chain by `Season.join_gate`; AnnounceSeason only by the program's upgrade authority; sponsored tips limited to three presets; settles charged to the requester (I-51) | yes | W2-A, W2-D, W3-A |
| O-M1-24 | Schedule: 7 waves, 12 weeks nominal (50% 12.5, 80% 14.5), ≈ 62.5 engineer-weeks; cut order ClaimDefence → herald WS → screenshot matrix → practice what-if (I-57) | accept; cut ClaimDefence first if wave 4 slips | all |
| O-M1-25 | **Rule (v1.12): no arrival at or after the season's end.** Depart refuses `arrive_bell ≥ end_bell` (`ArrivalBell`, §5.11 step 4), so the last useful Depart is at `end_bell − 3`. A player-visible rule change in the release `.so` (the kernel and `RULESET_HASH` unchanged). The alternatives (a proof-free settle branch for such arrivals, or gathers and resolves past `end_bell`) break I-44 or the laurel freeze (`w6-s7` triage `unsettled-transits.md`) | yes | W6 fix unit U1; the `w6-s7` re-run |
| O-M1-26 | **Three §13.4 clarifications (v1.12):** A1 an idle province-day also had no GATHER or CLASH; A2 a Reveal refused by rule is `unrevealed_by_rule` with its reason, not a liveness miss, and any such refusal of an `honest` march fails criterion 5; A3 a viewer error is one that survives the client's standard recovery (one stale keep-alive retry; connect and WS reconnect within the chaos restart budget), WS coverage ≥ 99 % outside outage windows, the error rate over requests + WS sessions. The stricter alternative for A3: keep every error, but exclude and report the requests inside herald kill-to-ready windows | yes | the `w6-s7` re-run, Gate W6, E5 |
| O-M1-27 | **A march refused by the shield rule settles ROUTED (M1).** A valid seal whose Reveal §5.11 step 6 refuses (`Shielded`: the attacker's own holding still shielded, or the destination another faction's shielded holding) cannot be revealed by anyone and routes the host (stamina 0) at SettleTransit. "Bounced, no loss" would need a new SettleTransit outcome, a program and verifier change and new tamper classes. The clients prevent the march instead: bots (U3), the keeper and relay `409 Shielded` at submission, the web in the W6-D follow-up below | keep ROUTED for M1 | the W6-D follow-up before any playtest |
| O-M1-28 | **Criterion 6's ingest → WS p99 under burst fan-out (integ-W6t).** With 1,000 WS viewers subscribed to every ring (A3's load), a slot in which ≈ 100 transactions land (the release of a held key, a herald restart's catch-up, a ring opening) sends ≈ 1,100 messages to each socket at once; the generator (one process for all 1,000 sockets) receives the tail of such a burst 2.0–2.5 s after the herald's ingest stamp. R5: p99 0.44 s until the first burst, 2.49 s after it. Options: (a) keep the 2-s p99 over the whole window; (b) judge ingest → WS outside the outage and hold-release windows, as A3 does for errors, and report the bursts; (c) herald or generator work first (receipt stamped before the JSON parse, the web client's real ring subscription, herald fan-out batching), then re-measure | (a) unchanged: the exit run is judged as written. **v1.13 (integ-W6t review):** the tail's owner was the generator, not the herald: every WS message now carries the herald's send stamp `s`, and R5's first burst replayed at its real pace against a separate `frontier-viewers` process (`herald/tests/burst.rs`, 72 transactions in slots 2075–2076, 1.41 M messages to 1,000 all-ring sockets, 4,000 pollers, load 4.4–5.2) gives ingest → WS p99 **3.28 s** with the pre-fix generator and **0.75 s** with the fixed one (buffered reads, stamps read without parsing the payload): herald share `s − t` p99 0.69 s, delivery p99 0.09 s. Criterion 6 is met as written on that replay, so (a) needs no amendment; the owner confirms (a) before the exit run | before the W7 exit run |
| O-M1-29 | **Criterion 3 and the adversary holds (integ-W6t).** Criterion 4 excludes the above-cap hold windows; criterion 3 excludes none. The `ticket` hold (1.0) and two `ticket_holder` persona holds (0.5, the keepers' D cap) fill the 100M block for ≈ 150 slots at bells 8–10 of every 20× run (W6T-3 §8), and `slots-below` delays one Reveal by design. Over 7 days these stay below the p99 (`w6-s7`: round → anchor max 154 but p99 6; anchor → last reveal p99 0 over 1,628); in a 1-day run they are the p99. Options: exclude the hold windows from criterion 3 as from criterion 4; cap concurrent holds; price the persona's hold below the D cap | unchanged (PLAN §4: criterion 3's slot targets are not amended); judged on the 7-day run | before the W7 exit run |

**W6-D web follow-up (recorded in v1.12; not needed for the exit run, needed before any playtest).** The web paths are W6-D's (§11) and no triage fix unit took them: (1) `permutation-server/web/frontier/fmarch.mjs` and `screens/march.mjs`: clamp the arrival bell to `end_bell − 1` and offer no Depart when the earliest arrival is ≥ `end_bell` (the program refuses it `ArrivalBell`, §9.6 shows the code); (2) `screens/holding.mjs` and `fland.mjs`: grey out other factions' holding sites as march targets while the player's own holding is shielded (at the planned arrival bell), and show the shield's end; `409 {code: "Shielded"}` from `/f/reveal` is shown with the same text. `session.mjs` is not touched. No web client plays in the exit run, the program refuses the end case, and the keeper and relay answer `409 Shielded`, so the exit does not wait for it.

## 16. Amendments, sources and links

- **Amendments:** only the integrator changes this file. Each change bumps a version line at the top (`v1.0` = the first issue, kept as `lab/contract-rev/M1-CONTRACT.v1.0.md`; `v1.1` = this review revision, §17), lists the sections changed, and is copied into `DECISIONS.md` if it resolves a conflict. Layout, tag, error-code and log-kind changes after wave 1 require an amendment and regenerated vectors in the same merge.

## 17. Revision notes (v1.1, 2026-09-27)

Each review issue was checked against DESIGN rev 3.1, the v1.0 text, the code at `d95fa25` and the M0/M1 labs (read-only; no repo change, no server, no chain transaction). Numbering follows the review's order (R1–R21). "Accepted" means the finding was confirmed; "merged" means it duplicates another; parts rebutted are named with their evidence.

| # | Severity | Finding (short) | Verdict and evidence | What changed (sections) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | blocker | Province entries (56) can overflow at ResolveFromInputs; the province freezes; faction cap leak | **Accepted.** `clash.rs` l. 652–671 seeds `per_faction`/`total` only from `!u.arrival` units, i.e. the state-1 residents in the input; Muster caps states 1–2 at 48 (v1.0 §5.10); state-3 entries wait for SettleDeparture, a class-D write (v1.0 §5.11). The reviewer's 40 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 57 case is reachable, and RFI had no refusal or bounce rule | I-43; §5.3 entry, §5.11 RFI, §7 `clash::Occupancy`, §13.1 storage fill, G8, W1-A, O-M1-21. The room is `min(48 − R − M, 56 − R − M − D)` in effect (v1.1 also counts pending musters against the 48, which the suggested `48 − R` did not); bit-identical when M = D = 0 |
| R2 | blocker | A bad seal is not reliably punished; a re-departed Stays host freezes another province | **Accepted, both parts.** v1.0 §5.5 classed ProveBadSeal N (tip-capped) and §5.11 let SettleTransit run at close + 600 without a verdict; ProveBadSeal refused archived bells; nothing blocked Depart/Dissolve/Explore of a host whose transit was unsettled. DESIGN §6.2's protection is a timing argument ("at least 20 minutes"), which a held account defeats | I-44: SettleTransit takes the logged `commit` + `seal`, opens and judges them (≤ 48.0k CU measured for the opener, budget 85k, tx ≈ 990 B); the archive stores each bell's signature so a late settlement still judges; ProveBadSeal and SealVerdict removed (suggestion 1 taken in full, SealVerdict not kept as an optimisation: one fewer kind, no race); `HostInTransit`; `Forfeit` pending op. §4.1, §4.3, §5.1–§5.6, §5.8, §5.11, §6, §8.2, §8.5, §8.6, §13.1–§13.4, O-M1-19 |
| R3 | blocker | `SetLoadedAccountsDataSizeLimit(65,536)` cannot load a ≈ 0.5 MB program | **Accepted.** SP-V2 `spv2.so` 480,512 B (plain v2) and 540,608 B (kprobe v2) vs SP-FEE's 13,600-B probe [measured]; SP-FEE RESULTS l. 76 and 213 pin 64 KiB. The conclusion holds whether or not SIMD-0186's exact accounting is active, because an invoked program's data was always loaded; the validator drill confirms the exact rule | I-45; §5.3 Season `reveal_loaded_limit`, §5.5, §7 `fees`, §8.1, §8.2, §8.7, §10.1 (tip_min 14,441 at the 1-MiB default), §10.2, §13.1 row, W1-F, W2-B drill |
| R4 | major | A closed ClashInputs can be created again; lifecycle status gaps | **Accepted.** v1.0 GatherClash checked window and absence only; OpenRing used `status ≥ Seeded` (includes Ended 4, Closed 5, Aborted 6); OpenProvince had no status check, and RingSeeds close only at CloseSeason, so CloseProvince → OpenProvince was possible before the final part | I-46; §4.2, §5.9, §5.11 (GatherClash `bell ≥ resolved_next`; SettleTransit needs flag 2), §13.2 re-creation tests |
| R5 | major | SettleTicket and ProveBadSeal are class N but close a window | **Accepted.** SettleTicket: the lottery depended on landing before `final_ts` against a fixed low bid. **Partly different fix:** the deadline is removed by cohorts (the reviewer's second option) and SettleTicket becomes class D; it is not made pool-eligible, which would re-open the D18 sizing (O-M1-08) for land. ProveBadSeal: solved by R2 | I-47 (supersedes I-19); §5.1, §5.3 Province cohorts and Citizen escrow, §5.5, §5.9, §8.2, §8.8, G12, E5 criterion 9, O-M1-20 |
| R6 | major | Global singletons written where the keeper does not defend | **Accepted.** v1.0 SettleTransit listed `[dpool w]` on every call, against DESIGN §8.6 rule 2 ("no shared pool account is ever on the critical path"); OpenRing/OpenProvince/CloseProvince/Fold wrote Frontier and one ProvinceFund at class N; FileTicket accepted a ring whose provinces did not exist yet (only `ring < rings_opened`) | I-48: `Holding.pool_owed` + SweepPoolOwed; ProvinceFund per wedge; openings and folds class D; FileTicket requires the Province; new lock table §8.8. §4.2, §5.2, §5.3, §5.5, §5.7, §5.9, §5.11, §5.12, §6 |
| R7 | major | The keeper payer pool drains one way; C4's ≥ 150 payers erode | **Accepted except one suggestion.** v1.0 §8.2: "the payer is also the rent payer; refunds go to the configured beneficiary"; SettleTicket (not a relay shape) made keeper payers the Holding's `rent_payer`. **Rebutted:** "refuse to run W writes while effective N < 150" — refusing would itself be the exclusion C4 guards against; v1.1 alerts, tops up from ≥ 4 funders and gates per-bell effective N in E5 instead | I-49 (rent back to the payer; two pools; band from R99), I-05/I-47 (the Holding is funded from the ticket funder's escrow, which gives the relay the refunds without a second signer); §8.2, §13.4 |
| R8 | major | No CU or heap escape hatch; SkipQuiet and RFI budgets inconsistent with their fills | **Accepted.** v1.0 §3.3 forbade heap frames and §10.2 capped the CU limit at the budget; SP-V2 PostAnchor 331,810–335,542 CU against a 345k budget before M1 additions; `program.md` l. 632–633 costs `is_quiet` at 10–30k per run and relies on a cache that the §13.1 fill (pending ops every bell) invalidates every bell | I-50; §3.3, §5.5, §5.11 SkipQuiet, §8.2 retry ladder, §10.2, §13.1, W4-A (all 1,240 fills with the full write-back) |
| R9 | major | Abuse paths of a free M1 | **Accepted, all four.** Invites existed only at the relay; settle shapes were "charged to the named holding's citizen"; the drain guard had no tip or CU-price ceiling; `/gw/*` adds `X-Forwarded-For` (hosting is post-M1, but the rule is cheap) | I-51; §5.3 Season `join_gate`, §5.4 codes 59/61, §5.7 AnnounceSeason, §5.9 Join, §8.3, §8.4, §8.6 personas, O-M1-23 |
| R10 | major | The defence refund can be pre-empted or erased | **Accepted** (merged with R19). **Chosen fix:** the claim grace in SettleTransit (the reviewer's first option), not copying evidence into ClashInputs (+1,344 B per province-bell for a feature that is first on the cut list) | I-52; §5.3 slot flags, §5.11, §5.12, §8.2, G12 |
| R11 | major | The verifier leaves rules unchecked | **Accepted, one claim rebutted.** "Tickets and explores have no digest in a chained record": SETTLE is chained on Citizen, Holding, Province and JoinShard and carries the score; EXPLORE_RESULT is chained on Holding and Citizen and carries the finds (v1.0 §6). The data was there; the checks were missing | I-58; §8.5 V5, V11–V13, T7, T17–T22; §13.4 criteria 8–9 |
| R12 | blocker | Gates W2–W4 need approvals nobody gave | **Accepted.** 32 rounds in `SP-V2/beacons/quicknet`; `rustup` lists no wasm32 target; §8.7 ruled out a test key; the archive must be contiguous (≈ 201,600 rounds for 7 days; ≈ 250k with the pre-season and margin) | I-53 (`test-beacon`, `--test-key`, `PENDING-OWNER`); §8.7, §12, §14, O-M1-12 dated and sized |
| R13 | blocker | The gate preamble aborts on this machine | **Accepted.** `lsof` shows node on 127.0.0.1:4191 and 4194 and play on 4185 (the owner's services) | §12 preamble (checks only M1's ports), I-26 |
| R14 | major | Mode A at 20× makes slots 20 ms | **Accepted.** v1.0 §8.7: "block builder per game slot (400 ms / scale)"; criterion 3 in game seconds; the announce lead was not in the 8.4 h | I-54; §8.7, §13.4 criterion 3, W6 latency run, pre-season at scale 2,000 |
| R15 | major | File ownership gaps and cross-edits | **Accepted, (a)–(h).** (a)(b)(c) manifests and locks → integrator; (d) prologue and entry codec in `frontier-abi` (W1-E), svm-tests harness to W2-B with area files handed over; (e) `web-sdk.test.mjs` to W2-D, `web-lang.test.mjs` to W2-E then W5-E; (f) `app.mjs` to W4-E; (g) G14 to W5-C; (h) `RETREAT_MAX_BPS` moves into `clash.rs` | I-55; §3.1, §3.4, §7, §11 |
| R16 | major | RFI can run out of Province entries (48 musters + 24 stays) | **Merged into R1** (same mechanism; this scenario is covered by the storage fill) | as R1 |
| R17 | major | The 64-KiB loaded-data limit ignores program size | **Merged into R3.** Both sizes it and R3 quote are real builds (540,608 B kprobe; 480,512 B plain). "LiteSVM may not enforce it" → `localnet` enforces SIMD-0186 accounting itself if LiteSVM does not, proved by a control test | as R3 |
| R18 | major | camp, explore and catalog are specified only by signature; the sim models camps differently | **Accepted.** `model.rs` l. 175–252 holds BUILDINGS, `build_secs`, `TROOP_COST_PER_100`, `WALL_*`, `STARTER_KIT`, `WORKS_*`; `sim.rs` models `Prov.camp: Option<Camp>` on a non-site tile with daily respawn (l. 87–103, 1119–1147) and instant training (l. 1535–1560) | I-56 (sim normative; one camp per province on a non-site tile + an initial camp; Train immediate; floor gives Works only); §5.3, §5.9, §5.10, §7, W1-C, W1-D equality test, O-M1-22 |
| R19 | major | ClaimDefence evidence does not live long enough | **Merged into R10.** Storing the anchor slot in the archive is unnecessary: claims end 6 bells after close, long before the 48-h archive | as R10 |
| R20 | major | The W3/W4 gates are the first integration; W1-E overloaded | **Accepted.** W1-E carried the ABI, a 50-tag skeleton, the crypto port, 10 instructions, the build script, the harness and g02–g05 in 1.5 weeks | I-57: 7 waves; W1-E → W1-E abi, W2-A program-core, W2-B svm-harness; W4-F integration unit (`itest`); G14 in W5; integration windows (§3.4); gates restated (§12) |
| R21 | major | The estimate is inconsistent and leaves out serialized costs | **Accepted.** v1.0 §0 said ≈ 45 ew; its §14 rows sum to 47 | §0, §14: 12 weeks nominal, ≈ 62.5 ew, 50% by 12.5 and 80% by 14.5 weeks, gate wall time, approval dates, N5 overshoot, cut order; O-M1-24 |

**Numbers that moved in v1.1:** `tip_min` 14,337 → 14,441 lamports at 26k CU (1-MiB loaded-data default; v1.0's "10,006 at 16k" was also rounded down, integer ceil gives 10,007, now 10,111); per-player rent 9,428,480 → 9,753,600 lamports (Citizen 384 B); AnchorArchive 5,280 → 12,192 B (7-day float ≈ 3.5 → ≈ 8.0 SOL, refundable); SettleTransit budget 30k → 85k and tx 900 → 1,100 B; FileTicket 8k → 14k CU; SkipQuiet `60k + 30k per recomputed bell`; account kinds 18 → 17; creation paths 20 → 19; tamper classes 16 → 22; personas 10 → 13; waves 6 → 7; estimate 10 weeks / 45–47 ew → 12 weeks / ≈ 62.5 ew.

**Residual risks stated, not solved:** player actions at priority 0 can be held at one account's price (DESIGN §8.6 accepts "the owner is delayed"); a displaced ticket ends instead of moving to its next preference; a self-revealing player can collect its own preset tip (≤ 2 × tip_min per march); the lock prices in §8.8 are DESIGN §8.7's model, not measurements; the exact SIMD-0186 accounting is confirmed on the installed 3.1.9 validator, not on mainnet (M4).

## 18. Amendments v1.2 (integ-W1, 2026-09-27)

The wave-1 review (six units) was answered in the integration window (§3.4). Each row is normative from v1.2; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W1 commits; decisions are copied to `DECISIONS.md` part G; the item-by-item response is `integ-W1-NOTES.md`.

| Section | Change | Why (review item) |
|---|---|---|
| §3.2 | `RULESET_HASH` binds a version constant for every module of `permutation_rules::frontier` (23 entries), the doctrine table, the stance damage table and `KERNEL_CONSTANTS`; the program embeds `frontier_abi::presets::RULESET_HASH` (a const pinned to the kernel by a test), not a build-step output | W1-C major: the hash was blind to CL-09/CL-10 |
| §4.1 | `po` = P i32, Q i32, bell u32, pos u8 → 13 raw / 28-B seed (SP-V2) | W1-C/W1-E erratum |
| §4.2 | Whole-account refund floor = `rent(0)` = 650,240 lamports | W1-E: 890,880 was the old rate |
| §5.3 | ArrivalSlot `flags` bit 2 = created_day (Reveal sets it, a displacement clears it) | W1-C major: `defence_refund` needs it |
| §5.4, §5.10 | Build past a CL-02 cap (walls > 1,200) → `Kernel` 15 (`HoldingError::AboveCap`); UI §9.6 maps it like other kernel refusals | W1-B |
| §5.5 | `MULTI_MAX_REGIONS` = 7; FoldOccupancy ceiling 1,232; tx ceilings gate on `budgets::tx_ceiling` (the byte model), the table's "Tx B max" is informative where below it | W1-E |
| §5.6 | Step 1 checks the status before the ruleset; `Auth` = a missing signature, `BadAccount` = writability; step 3 (bucket) runs before step 4 (`PlayerStart::finish`) | W1-E major |
| §5.9 | FoldOccupancy in three parts (24 shards / 24 shards / 6 funds, `FoldStale` between parts); SettleTicket's seed account `seedcache\|archive`; ring 0 (the Concord) funded from wedge 0 | W1-E major; W1-F; W1-E finding |
| §5.12 | Refund priority fee `⌈price × limit / 10⁶⌉` (the runtime's rounding); `created_day` from the slot flags | W1-F; W1-C |
| §6 | RING_SEED chains nothing; SEASON_CREATED (138 B) is an exception to the soft 128-B ceiling | W1-E |
| §7 | `seal::validate` also refuses a direction ≥ 6 and `dest_tile ≥ 61` (I-28); `clash` keeps a private `valid_faction` pinned by a test; `host::GarrisonState` is capped at `MAX_HOST_TROOPS`; `mandate::Reserve::final_sweep(open_terms)`; `siege::Vigil` first-window rule "a day after the last old window started"; `geometry::ProvinceCoord::{index, from_index}` are total | W1-A major, W1-B major, W1-C major |
| §8.7 | drand-replay: `round_time + delay ≤ game_now`, `game_now` = the last observed Clock (no extrapolation); port checks use the §10.3 `lsof` rule | W1-F |
| §12 | Gate W1's `doctrine-gate --controls` runs the Season-1 economy (D23, caretaker term exempt) at 60 gate seeds; `catalog_equality` compiles unconditionally (no `FRONTIER_REQUIRE_CATALOG`) | W1-D majors |


---

## 19. Amendments v1.3 (integ-W2, 2026-09-28)

The wave-2 review (six units) was answered in the integration window (§3.4). Each row is normative from v1.3; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W2 review commits; decisions are copied to `docs/frontier/DECISIONS.md` part I; the item-by-item response is `integ-W2-NOTES.md` §6.

| Section | Change | Why (review item) |
|---|---|---|
| §4.1, §5.2, §5.3, §5.8, §5.11 | **AnchorArchive per region and half day**: `aa‖region,part` with `part = bell / 72`; 6,144 B (72 entries of 84 B, bitmaps of 9 B, `rent_to` at 6,112), rent 31,861,760; ArchiveAnchors data `region, part, n, bells` with every `bell / 72 == part`; every reader addresses the archive of `part(bell)`. Float of a 7-day season ≈ 8.2 SOL | W2-A F2 (confirmed): 12,192 B exceeds the 10,240 B a program can allocate by CPI in one instruction, so ArchiveAnchors could not create v1.1's day archive |
| §4.2 | `close_to` does not log; every closing instruction emits `CLOSE` itself before calling it (hand-over rule in `proc/mod.rs`) | W2-A minor: the unlisted departure from §4.2 |
| §5.3, §13.1, G10 | Seal code 3 reserved, never emitted by the M1 opener: a seal to another round is code 1 (FO failure); §13.1's row lists codes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 | W2-A minor, W2-B major: code 3 is not distinguishable from 1 |
| §5.5 | Budgets AnnounceSeason 18k → **25k**, InitBeaconLogs 60k → **80k**, InitShards 40k → **45k** (`frontier-abi::budgets`, vectors, fclient mirror) | W2-A F3 / major: 18,570, 74,688 and 39,313 CU [measured, `g01_budget_w2a`] |
| §5.7 | SetWindowSchedule: **one change per season** (a second call is `AlreadyDone`; `reveal_window` is never rewritten); `from_bell < end_bell` else `BadData` (refuses the `u32::MAX` sentinel) | W2-A major: the fold changed `W(b)`, hence `S(b, r)`, for bells whose caches, gathers or settlements could still be pending |
| §5.7 | CreateSeason refuses `program_version ≠` the binary's `PROGRAM_VERSION` (`BadData`) | W2-A minor |
| §8.2 | A capped write whose versions all expired ends (failure, backoff, `write-expired` alert) and is re-planned; the anchor scan window always reaches the newest bell (`anchor-missing` alert) | W2-F major: a hold longer than 64 versions + expiry stalled the write and the scan window for good |
| §8.3 | Exact account keys and ABI writability in the relay allowlist; settle quotas charged to a requester's on-chain-verified Citizen, else the client-address bucket; the replay key is claimed before any await; a send that throws charges nothing; simulation failures attributed to the failing program (System → `OperatorLowFunds`) | W2-D majors and minors |
| §8.7 | `localnet`'s block and account caps count the §10.1 cost, not the CU limit | W2-C major |
| §9.1 | The web chain clock runs at rate 1 except on a localnet season (estimated there, never below 1); staleness is measured against the local clock, not the herald-derived estimate | W2-E major |
| §9.4 | `messageProblems` requires the blockhash and the expected instruction and runs the relay allowlist; `sealMarch` derives the round from the season clock (T(arrive_bell)) and refuses any other | W2-E majors |
| §12 | Gate W2 runs `g01_budget_` too; `one_day_beacons` rings are exercised against the program from Gate W3 (OpenRing is W3-A's) | W2-A major (no CU gate); W2-F missing item (gate text vs the unit split) |

## 20. Amendments v1.4 (integ-W3, 2026-09-28)

Made in the wave-3 integration window (§3.4) to answer a Gate W3 item; normative from v1.4; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W3 commits; the decision is copied to `DECISIONS.md` part J; the record is `integ-W3-NOTES.md`.

| Section | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| §5.5 | Budget FileTicket 14k → **17k** CU (`frontier-abi::budgets`, vectors, fclient mirror, synced JS) | W3-A F3: 16,048 CU [measured, `g01_file_ticket_three_provinces_full_cohorts`: 3 provinces, 7 open cohorts each, the §13.1 fill] on the merged release `.so`; the cost is the player prologue (≈ 3.6k), three canonical Province addresses and their cohorts (≈ 3.7k), the escrow System CPI (≈ 2.2k) and the 4-chain `TICKET` (≈ 3.5k). FileTicket is class P (relay-sponsored, priority 0, no liveness role), so the budget moves no fee or tip formula |

Not amended in this window (open for the wave-3 review; recorded in `integ-W3-NOTES.md`): W3-A F4 (`chains_of(SETTLE)` and a shared JoinShard), F5 (§5.9 Join's wedge-fund clause), F8 (terrain encoding and ticket score in a shared crate), W3-B's presets request (`reveal_cu_limit`, `reveal_loaded_limit`, `tip_min`: to be regenerated from the release `.so` at W5), W3-C F1 (crowding rule), W3-D D2/D3/D6, W3-F R4 (`reachable`'s signature).

---

## 21. Amendments v1.5 (integ-W3, 2026-09-28, after the wave-3 review)

The wave-3 review (six units, verdict needs-fix for each) was answered in the integration window (§3.4). Each row is normative from v1.5; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W3 review commits; decisions are copied to `DECISIONS.md` part K; the item-by-item response is `integ-W3-NOTES.md` §6.

| Section | Change | Why (review item) |
|---|---|---|
| §5.9 FileTicket | `ticket_funder = payer` only when the payer tops the escrow up (`rent(1,280) − ticket_escrow > 0`); otherwise the stored funder is kept; `TICKET.funder` logs the effective funder. (Every escrow is 0 or `rent(1,280)` in M1, so a top-up is always the whole escrow.) | W3-A major: a self-paid refile over a sponsor's escrow took the sponsor's refunds |
| §5.9 | Join's capacity clause is `rings_opened ≤ r_max` only (the fund condition is OpenRing's, which lists the funds; W3-A D2); the vigil's weekly rule is measured from `vigil_from_ts` (D4); ring occupancy counts a wedge only when `wedge_open > 0` (D5); FileTicket's `ticket_bell ≠ now_bell` is dropped (vacuous once `ticket_bell == u32::MAX` is required; F7) | W3-A D2, D4, D5, F7 (recorded as implemented) |
| §5.4 keeper mapping | `NoTicket` (23) ends a **SettleTicket** write as done (like `AlreadyDone`): the ticket ended, whichever version or keeper ended it (`fclient::abi::err::is_done`) | W3-A minor: a late or replanned version was a failure with backoff |
| §5.5 | Budgets Harvest 12k → **17.5k**, Train 15k → **17.5k**, Explore 18k → **20k**, Depart 15k → **24.5k** (measured 16,373 / 16,605 / 18,829 / 23,133 CU at the §13.1 fill on the review build, + 5%, rounded up to 500; the player prologue now checks the Season once). All four are class P (relay-sponsored, priority 0): no fee or tip formula moves. `g01_budget_w3b_*` assert every ceiling (no print-only mode) | W3-B major (G1 breaches); the Holding codec, the kernel accrual and Depart's transfer CPI and record make the old figures unreachable without a codec rewrite |
| §5.10 DisbandStranded | Obeys the roster freeze: a host in a roster (entry state 1, or 2 muster-pending) is disbanded as the pending op **Forfeit issued at `now_bell`** (province resolved through `now_bell − 2`, else `NotResident`; another pending change `HostBusy`); the resolve or skip of that bell frees the entry, its post-clash troops lost (W4-A). A departed entry (state 3) and any entry once the province has resolved every bell of the season (`resolved_next ≥ end_bell`) is freed at once. `STRANDED.troops_lost` is the troops at issue (milli). Keepers skip entries already pending Forfeit | W3-B major: a class-N disband could remove a defender from a frozen roster |
| §5.10, §5.11 (for W4-A) | **The return of troops is W4-A's.** The resolve or skip of `pend_bell` MUST NOT free a `Leave` entry (Dissolve): it keeps it (state 3, op `Leave`, post-clash values) until a return settle — class D, keeper duty (W4-C) — credits `reserve[unit] += troops / 1,000` (whole troops, rounded down) to the host's Holding and frees the entry (Holding absent or re-founded: troops lost, entry freed). The instruction (a new tag, or a SettleDeparture variant) is W4-A's choice, recorded in its notes and in v1.6. Garrison stays **positive deltas only** until the same step returns withdrawals. The resolve also frees a pending `Forfeit` (above) and keeps every state-3 departed entry until SettleDeparture (SettleDeparture's `NotResident` on a missing entry is then unreachable) | W3-B major (troops never came back), minor (SettleDeparture) |
| §5.11 Reveal | Step 1's Ended clause (`arrive ≥ end_bell` → `WrongStatus`) is checked as soon as the transit record is read, before the plaintext | W3-B minor |
| §5.3, §6 | ArrivalSlot flag bit 2 and `REVEAL.arrivalday_created` mean **"this Reveal wrote the day's bit"** (the day was write-locked), whether or not the ArrivalDay account already existed | W3-B minor (text vs code) |
| §6 units | `MUSTER.troops`, `TRAIN.n` whole troops; `DISSOLVE.delta`, `GARRISON.delta`, `STRANDED.troops_lost`, entries, transits and slots milli-troops | W3-B minor |
| §6 chains | `chains_of(SETTLE, DISPLACE)`: the displaced citizen's JoinShard link is **optional** (absent when both citizens share one JoinShard, chained once). A creation record after `CLOSE` starts a **new chain at the same address** (`seq` 1 from a zero head; indexers key a chain by address and creation, not by address alone). The svm harness checks every record's tail against `chains_of(..).bounds()` | W3-A major (F4), minor (chain restart) |
| §5.11 SettleTransit (for W4-B) | The slot account of an arrival with no slot of its own is the ArrivalSlot `(dest, arrive, faction, 0)`; the program treats a present slot whose `host_id` is not this host as "no slot of this host" (never pays its beneficiary). Clients take the slot and the resolver from the arrival bell's own envelope (`/h/province/{P},{Q}/{arrive}`) | W3-E major; W3-F minor |
| §8.1, §8.4 | A PS2 body counts only when printed inside the program's own invoke frame (`Program <id> invoke [n]` … `success/failed`; `fclient::log::bodies_from_logs(logs, program)`); findex skips an undecodable body (no batch failure) | W3-D major, W3-C major |
| §8.2 keeper | Land index: a JOIN whose wallet is not its key's canonical Citizen is refused, and a displaced holder's wallet is used only after `addrs.citizen(wallet) == citizen` or a read of the Citizen. Tickets settle **oldest cohort first**, then the lottery order, with the outcome predicted per candidate; a fresh settlement waits (≤ 300 slots) while a same-cohort ticket that will not win its current site has this site later with a better score. Crowding rings: OpenRing(d > g) only once ring d − 1 is complete and a whole fold of a later bell landed (keeper policy; the program's rule is unchanged). A remembered SeedCache is re-checked every 150 slots and the archive used once it is closed | W3-C majors and minors |
| §8.4 herald | WebSocket writes are bounded (2 × heartbeat; a peer that stops reading is closed 1013 and counted `dropped_slow`); `/h/me` forwards the caller's address to `/f/quota` as `X-Forwarded-For`; a re-fold that finds the same bytes syncs them with the next checkpoint | W3-D major and minors |
| §8.6 bots | Late joins are drawn over `[144, join_close_bell)` (the simulator's 21-of-28 ratio: 756 in a 7-day season); the fleet re-deals with the season's own `join_close_bell` | W3-E major |
| §9.4 web | The composer's earliest arrival bell assumes a departure 90 s after now and is recomputed at send (a stale choice is `ArrivalBell` before sealing); SettleExplore names a present cache of round S of THE anchor (or the archive); the chronicle starts at `headSeq − 500`; incoming warnings judge departures at cavalry pace; the page loads the envelopes of every province where it has a host; a gated season shows the invite field; a hidden page runs only the self-reveal tick (60 s). W3-F D10 replaces §9.4's "fetch the landed transaction back through the herald" by the check that the relay's signature is the fee payer's over the signed message | W3-F majors; W3-F missing item (D10) |

Not amended here (owners named in `integ-W3-NOTES.md` §6 and DECISIONS K): the presets (`reveal_cu_limit` ≥ 26.4k, `reveal_loaded_limit`, `tip_min`) from the final `.so` (W5-A); F8 and W3-B's encodings moved into `frontier-abi`/the kernel (W4-D before the verifier); `reachable`'s road-optimistic signature (R4, frontier-wasm owner); the herald's `.gz`/`.br` siblings (owner question J2); and the cross-cohort finding (a later cohort's ticket may settle fresh at a site whose earlier cohort is open, which makes the earlier winner `taken`; keepers now settle the oldest cohort first, but a player who holds the Province for about a bell and settles his own later ticket still beats I-47's 24-bell bound: an architect decision, K9).

---

## 22. Amendments v1.6 (integ-W4, 2026-09-28)

Made in the wave-4 integration window (§3.4): the wave note's decisions (O-M1-12 item 1, J2, K9, the §21 return), the gate fixes of Gate W4, and the wave-4 units' pinned choices accepted as the contract's reading until the wave-4 review. Normative from v1.6; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W4 commits; decisions are copied to `DECISIONS.md` part L (and part A for O-M1-12); the record is `integ-W4-NOTES.md`.

| Section | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| §5.9 SettleTicket | A fresh settlement waits (`TicketState`) while an earlier ticket cohort of the same Province is open; displacement and `taken` unchanged | K9 decided by the main session (DECISIONS L4); failing-first svm test `citizen_cohort_fresh_waits_for_an_earlier_open_cohort` |
| §5.10, §5.11, §6 (the §21 return) | **The return settle is SettleDeparture with `transit_slot = 0xFF`** (accounts `[payer s] [season] [province w] [holding w]`, class D, keeper duty): every state-3 `Leave` entry of that Holding in that Province is freed; `reserve[unit] += troops / 1,000` when the Holding is live with the host's generation (`DEPARTURE_SETTLED` with **`destroyed = 2` = returned**), else `STRANDED` (troops lost); nothing to return `AlreadyDone`. Garrison withdrawals stay refused (positive deltas only) | W4-A D1 (DECISIONS L1); §21 left the shape to W4-A |
| §5.3 | ClashInputs offset 76 (`RSV_76`) is **`camp_mask`** (bit k: the arrival at position k took the camp, `WORKS_CAMP`); `Province.quiet_ok` is reserved (never written) | W4-A D2, D5 (the frontier-abi rename is W5-A's) |
| §5.11 GatherClash | `holdings_bitmap` bit k = absolute position k; `n ≥ 1` (range checked first); bells `≥ end_bell` are never gathered, resolved or skipped (`WrongStatus`); a destroyed-at-origin transit gathers as a record with `present = 0`, fate Destroyed; an absent, released or re-founded Holding as not present | W4-A §1, D7; the bitmap and the empty range were a keeper/program mismatch found by Gate W4's inproc_day (DECISIONS L6) |
| §5.11 ResolveFromInputs, SkipQuiet | W4-A's pinned rules: residents and arrivals to the kernel in id order; the camp is a NEUTRAL garrison (troops × 1,000, capped) only while fewer than 12 garrisons stand; the day's camp check (I-56) at the first resolve or skip of a day with `camp_seed = sha256("PSF-CAMP-v1" ‖ province[TERRAIN ..= SITE_COUNT])`, a spawn replaces a present camp; the camp clears below one whole troop or when hostile hosts hold its hex; **SkipQuiet's CU-aware stop (I-50) is a work bound** (`sol_remaining_compute_units` is not active on mainnet): at most one kernel quiet test per transaction, the trivial quiet test otherwise, a later non-trivially-quiet bell commits the prefix | W4-A §1, D3, D4, D6 |
| §5.11 closes | CloseClashInputs: flag 2, a `settled_mask` bit for every recorded host, `resolved_ts + clash_close_grace × 600 ≤ now − genesis_ts`, `rent_to` must match; CloseArrivalDay: `resolved_next ≥ 144 (day + 1)`; CloseArrivalSlot: settled and (claimed, or `close + 6 bells`, an absent canonical anchor meaning archived) or the season's end + 72 h. **Open (DECISIONS L10):** SettleTransit sets bits only for present records, so a record with a host id and `present = 0` can block CloseClashInputs for good | W4-A §1; integ-W4 finding |
| §5.11 SettleTransit, SweepPoolOwed, ClaimDefence, ArchiveAnchors, CloseSeedCache, EndSeason, AbortSeason, CloseSeason | W4-B's P1–P16 (`W4-B-NOTES.md` §2) are the contract's reading: statuses, the anchor/archive account, the destination rule for bad seals, the slot index and its rent (P6), payments and `DIVERT` (P5), returning hosts (P7), the bad-seal Forfeit (P8), the `TRANSIT_SETTLED` payload (P9), the archive and cache rules (P11, P12), the lifecycle (P13–P15), ClaimDefence per claim (P16). **Open:** W4-B F1 (a bad seal's destination) and F3 (CloseSeason cannot close RingSeeds, AnchorArchives, DefenceClaims) — architect | W4-B notes §2, §6 |
| §6 | CLASH `input_digest = sha256("PSF-CLASH-INPUT-v1" ‖ le32(b) ‖ seed ‖ province[SITE_MIRROR .. TICKET_COHORTS] before ‖ inputs[ARRIVALS .. POSTURES])`; SKIP `quiet_digest = sha256("PSF-QUIET-v1" ‖ le32(b0) ‖ n ‖ province[SITE_MIRROR .. TICKET_COHORTS] after)`; `DEPARTURE_SETTLED.destroyed = 2` = returned | W4-A §1 (W4-D and W4-E asked for the formulas; V7 checks them from W5) |
| §5.4 keeper mapping, §8.2 | The keeper also ends a SettleDeparture/SettleTransit write as done on `TransitState` and a ResolveFromInputs/SkipQuiet write on `OutOfOrder`; a faction group's final set is revealed in one slot with a 1-milli rank bid bonus; arrivals outside the final set go straight to SettleTransit; a bad seal nobody revealed is settled against its origin | W4-C notes §7 |
| §5.5, §10.2 (I-45) | `L(kind)` from a **1-MiB placeholder `.so`** (programdata 1,310,720 B; the merged wave-4 release `.so` is 1,021,160 B); `M1_LOCAL_7D.reveal_loaded_limit = L(Reveal) = 1,343,488`.

## 23. Amendments v1.7 (integ-W4 review response, 2026-09-28)

The wave-4 review's blockers and majors, verified against the code in the integration window (§3.4). Every change listed here has a test that fails on the old rule or measures the new bound. Normative from v1.7. The code landed in the integ-W4 commits `ef9a99a` (program, ABI v1.7), `c617966` (keeper), `4886140` (verifier), `c46601e` (bots, itest) and `891b229` (web). Decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part M; the verdicts and rebuttals are in `integ-W4-NOTES.md` §6.

| Section | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| §5.11 SkipQuiet (I-50, I-56) | The day's camp check is **provisional** for the bell where the skip stops: it is undone (camp restored, the CAMP spawn record dropped), so the committed bells leave exactly what resolving them would. Budget **90,000 CU + 30,000 per recomputed bell** (was 60,000). The keeper takes the limit from `frontier_abi::budgets::cu_gate` and reads a SkipQuiet that exceeds its CU as NotQuiet | Review (W4-A): G1 breach. A kernel-quiet, 48-resident roster measured 112,410 CU over 24 bells (svm `g01_skip_quiet_kernel_quiet_roster_budget`); `g11_skip_stop_commits_exactly_its_bells` |
| §5.10 return settle | SettleDeparture `0xFF` frees at most **3** Leave entries per transaction (`RETURN_MAX`); the keeper repeats it | Review (W4-A): unbounded loop. 10,082 CU for 3 of 5 (`clash_return_settle_is_bounded`) |
| §5.11 closes (v1.6 open item, DECISIONS L10) | CloseClashInputs needs a `settled_mask` bit **only for present records**. Inputs of a no-arrival bell that was skipped past (`FLAG_NO_ARRIVALS`, `resolved_next > bell`) close after the grace from that bell's end. CloseClashInputs and CloseArrivalDay also close once the season has been **Ended for 72 h** | L10 resolved; `clash_close_clash_inputs_needs_only_present_records`, `clash_close_no_arrival_inputs_after_a_skip`, `clash_closes_after_the_season_end` |
| §5.3, §5.11 GatherClash, SettleTransit (W4-B F1) | GatherClash **stamps** each recorded transit with its destination (Transit `DEST_P` @89, `DEST_Q` @91, `FLAG_GATHERED` = 4). The listed Holdings are writable, and GATHER chains every present, distinct listed Holding. SettleTransit settles a stamped transit **only at the stamped destination** (`BadAddress` otherwise). Budget GatherClash **49,000** (46,347 measured). Log `MAX_LINKS` 12, `MAX_RECORD` 800 | Review (W4-B F1): a bad seal's destination was the settler's word. `g12_gathered_bad_seal_settles_only_at_its_destination` shows the pre-v1.7 escape |
| §5.11 SettleTransit | A **valid seal to an absent destination** settles routed at the canonical absent address, timed by the anchor of its own region. With a bad seal and an absent destination the settle is refused `BadAccount` | `g12_valid_seal_to_an_absent_province_routes` |
| §5.11 SettleTransit (I-56 camp loot) | Optional **14th account `camp_citizen`** (W): the lowest `camp_mask` position whose fate is Stays credits `camp::loot()` to the owner Citizen's WORKS (`expect_key` = Holding.OWNER_CITIZEN; `BadAccount` when missing). `TRANSIT_SETTLED` then chains the Citizen (optional `OfHolding` link) | Review (W4-B): the camp's Works were never paid. `g12_settle_credits_the_camp_works_to_one_winner` |
| §5.11 CloseHolding, CloseCitizen (W4-B F3, players' part) | Both run on the **Closed tombstone**; `pool_owed` goes to the authority (position 4) | `close_holding_and_citizen_on_the_tombstone`. RingSeeds, AnchorArchives and DefenceClaims remain open (architect, W5; M1 moves no money) |
| §5.5 budgets | ClaimDefence **25,500** (24,111 measured + 5%). `abi-vectors` tag **v1.7**; the JS SDK and web `abi.mjs` are regenerated | W4-B F6 |
| §8.2 keeper | A reveal-group member whose Reveal the program refuses for good (anything but SlotMoved, NoAnchor, TooEarly) leaves the group. An outranked member is re-planned, not refused. A member held back by backoff holds the members below it. THE anchor is fetched for groups in flight. Settles use the stamp, then `dest_of`, then the origin only for a bad seal | Review (W4-C blocker); program test `reveal_group_survives_an_unrevealable_top` |
| §8.4, §8.6, §9.5 | **One off-chain ClashInput builder:** `fclient::clash_model` (the program's `model::build`, transcribed once). The herald's clash check and the verifier's V7 use it. The page's `buildClashArgs` is pinned to it by the `clash_model` cross-vectors in `frontier-vectors.json`. `certain` = the day's camp check does not run at the bell. A SeedCache counts only if it names THE anchor's A. Moving the model into `frontier-abi` is still W4-A D8 (W5-A) | Review (W4-D, W4-E): three copies, two wrong |
| §6, §8.6 verifier | V7 checks the v1.6 `input_digest`/`quiet_digest` formulas and the program's write-back. V1 resolves InTx links through the instruction's account order and post-state headers (an unchained program account in a transaction is CHAIN_GAP). V8 checks the stamina refill on arrival and the return settle. V11 checks camps by the program's day check. V13 checks intended recipients and `pool_owed`. Fixture `march-program.json.gz` is recorded from the program | Review (W4-D): V-checks disagreed with an honest program season |
| §12 Gate W4 | New line: the keeper play tests on the test-beacon `.so`. `inproc_day` pairs every Depart with exactly one TRANSIT_SETTLED, and bounds NotResident refusals (≤ 25% per action; the bots nudge a lagging province). Its size cannot shrink without `ITEST_ALLOW_SMALL=1`, and stub mode fails | Review (W4-C, W4-F) |

## 24. Amendments v1.8 (integ-W5, 2026-09-28)

Made in the wave-5 integration window (§3.4): the wave-5 units' amendment requests (W5-A notes §7, W5-E R4), the wave note's items and the gate fixes of Gate W5. Normative from v1.8. The code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W5 commits; decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part N (and part A for O-M1-12); the record is `integ-W5-NOTES.md`.

| Section | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| §5.2, §5.7 CloseSeason (W4-B F3) | **Parts 8, 9 and 10** close the float: part 8 RingSeeds → the stored `payer`, part 9 AnchorArchives → `rent_to`, part 10 DefenceClaims → `beneficiary`. Accounts: the ten fixed ones of every part, then 1–24 `[target w] [recipient w]` pairs in the repeat group (odd or empty `TooManyAccounts`; a part above 10 `BadData`). Each target is found by its own key fields at its canonical address (`BadAddress`); the recipient must be the stored one (`BadAccount`); an absent target is skipped (a repeat lands). Part 8 has the status rule of parts 0–6; parts 9 and 10 run only on the Closed tombstone or an Aborted season (`TooEarly`). Each close logs `CLOSE`. Off chain: `fclient::ix::close_season_float` | W5-A §1.1; svm `g13_close_season_float_parts`, `…_on_an_aborted_season`, `g01_budget_close_season_float_parts` (part 10 35,169 CU at 10 pairs) |
| §5.3 | ClashInputs offset 76 is named **`CAMP_MASK`** (u32) in `frontier-abi` (was `RSV_76`; the meaning is v1.6's). The web decodes it (`campMask`) | W5-E R4; the rename changes no byte |
| §5.4 | `SiteTaken` (11) and `Aborted` (50) are **reserved in M1**: no path emits them (a taken site is the SETTLE outcome `taken`, I-47; an Aborted season answers `WrongStatus`) | W5-A §1.2; `cover::EXEMPT`, `g13_coverage_exempt_codes_are_reserved_ones` |
| §5.5, §10.2 (I-45) | CU limits = **G1 maximum + 5 %** per kind, rounded up to 500 (`budgets::MEASURED`; the gates `cu_budget` unchanged). `L(kind)` at the release `.so`: `PLACEHOLDER_SO_LEN` **884,736** (programdata 1,105,920). Presets `M1_LOCAL_7D.reveal_cu_limit` **26,500**, `reveal_loaded_limit` **1,146,880** (`tip_min` 14,668; presets 14,668 / 22,002 / 29,336). A `.so` that outgrows the table fails `g01_loaded_limit_table_covers_the_release_so`. ABI vectors tag **v1.8** | W5-A §2.2, §2.3. Release `.so` 1,032,184 → 865,640 B with the kernel's shared sort (digest-identical), 873,600 B at integ-W5's head |
| I-14, O-M1-04, §5.5 | **Phase B adopted** on its working default (every I-14 gate re-passes: doctrine proxy gate, 1,500-season band 6/6, native = on chain over 1,244 fills; RFI max 274,007 CU). **Committed by W6-B**, not in wave 5: `CLASH_VERSION` 3, the three golden tests regenerated, RFI gate 340,000 → **290,000**, every outcome vector regenerated by its owner, then the doctrine gate and the criterion re-run | W5-A §4, `phaseB-gate/RESULTS.md` |
| §5.11, §8.4, §8.6, §9.5 (W4-A D8) | **One clash model:** `frontier_abi::clash_model` is the program's model (build, write-back, settle, next due, trivial quiet, finish, camp check, digests). The program runs it with its heap-trace checkpoints (`Probe`) and maps `ModelError` to its codes; `fclient::clash_model` (herald, verifier V7's clash check, itest G14) calls it instead of a transcription. The verifier's independent SKIP and Holding replays (`verify::skip`, `verify::holding`) stay independent by design. The WASM's `resolve_from_inputs` (W6-D) should call it | wave note item 4; integ-W5 `8871e2a` (svm 243/243, CU per kind unchanged but GatherClash +204, RFI −2,254, SkipQuiet −35,636) |
| §5.11 (return settle) | The bounced-resident `Leave` rule stands as v1.5 §21 and v1.6 §22 wrote it, now tested end to end (a resident bounced by the kernel leaves at the bell with its post-clash troops; the return settle credits a live Holding and strands a re-founded one) | W5-A §1.4; `clash_bounced_resident_leaves_and_returns` |
| §8.2 | Open (architect, W6): CloseSeedCache, CloseArrivalSlot and CloseArrivalDay need Running or Ended, so keeper float created after the final CloseSeason part cannot close | W5-A O4 |
| §8.5 | V7 checks every SKIP bell by bell (the kernel's `is_quiet` at every bell, the write-back byte for byte), replays every Harvest, Build and Train (`HoldingReplayMismatch`); V5 answers `MissingData` for a seal whose `T(arrive)` signature no transaction carried. `frontier-verify tamper` runs T1–T22 on any run (run fallbacks T8 fill, T13 moved, T14 any, T20 injected; builders return `Result`) | W5-D §1 |
| §12 (Gate W5) | The frontier-stack lines run as written with the test key. `frontier-stack tamper` judges a class the run cannot express on the committed fixture and labels it (`--strict` refuses that). G14 is `itest::g14_two_game_days` | W5-B, W5-C, integ-W5 gate |
| §13.3 G7 | The program-level lag gate also runs in LiteSVM (`g07_lag_gate_in_litesvm`: held vs unheld, byte-identical inputs, digests and Province state) | W5-A §1.3 |
| §13.1 | The G1 table is regenerated from a full-suite CU log (`PSF_CU_LOG`), not per-test prints | W5-A §2.2 |

## 25. Amendments v1.9 (integ-W5 review response, 2026-09-28)

Made in the wave-5 integration window after the wave-5 review (§3.4). Normative from v1.9. Decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part O; the record is `integ-W5r-NOTES.md`; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the integ-W5r commits.

| Section | Change | Why / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| §5.5, §10.2 (I-50) | **CU limits may pass the gate by at most 5 % of the gate** (rounded up to 500). The G1 maximum stays within the gate; the limit keeps its 5 % headroom (Reveal 26,500 on a 26,000 gate; PostAnchor 356,500 on 345,000). `budgets::tests` asserts both bounds | review of W5-A (eight kinds requested above their gate); capping at the gate would leave Reveal 3.2 % and PostAnchor 1.7 % of headroom, which v1.5 already declined for Reveal |
| §5.5 SettleDeparture | Gate **15,000 → 48,000 CU**. The return settle (`transit_slot = 0xFF`) scans all 48 entries: with the Holding absent (released) each foreign Leave entry's owner is found by address (one derivation per foreign run). Worst fill (48 entries, 45 foreign `Leave`, the settled three last): **43,083 CU** absent, **13,240 CU** live (was 46,758 / 25,148 before matching hosts by their id bits). `MEASURED` 43,083, limit 45,500 | review of W5-A: 18,344 CU seen, 15k gate; `g01_budget_settle_return_worst` (release and test-beacon, sent again at the table's limit) |
| §5.2, §5.7 CloseSeason 8–10 | **At most 10 pairs for parts 8 and 10, 2 for part 9** (`frontier_abi::budgets::close_float_pairs_max`; more is `TooManyAccounts`). At the caps every part fits the table's CU limit, 1,232 B and `L(CloseSeason)` with no client adjustment (supersedes v1.8's "+6,272 B per archive pair"). `fclient::ix::close_season_float_all` splits longer lists | review of W5-A: at 24 pairs parts 9 and 10 passed the 60k gate; `g01_budget_close_season_float_parts` at the caps with the client profile; `budgets::tests::close_float_caps` |
| §13.1 | The G1 table is generated by `permutation-frontier/svm-tests/cu-table.py` from a full-suite `PSF_CU_LOG` (`--write`; `--check` exits 1 on drift). **Heap:** the harness asserts heap ≤ 28 KiB on every landed trace-build transaction; `svm-tests/trace-sweep.sh` runs the whole suite on the trace builds (49 kinds; maximum 15,320 B, ResolveFromInputs) | review of W5-A (table did not match the log; heap asserted only where a test ran the trace build) |
| §13.3 G7 | `g07_lag_gate_in_litesvm` runs four cases: arrival bells 16–18, holds of 1–5 bells, march sizes 200–2,400 against 300–1,800, a second never-held arrival from another region, and the origin resolved through the real GatherClash + ResolveFromInputs in two cases; stays, bounces and a destruction are all seen, every pair byte-identical | review of W5-A |
| §7 kernel | `m1_rules_keep_the_31f1aa1_digests` pins `resolve_clash` with the M1 rules over the 4,320 lab inputs (empty and random room), recorded on the `31f1aa1` kernel (before the shared sort); the sort test checks random three-word keys | review of W5-A (the reference-vs-optimised test cannot see a wrong key in a shared helper) |
| §8.5 V7 | **Holding continuity:** every Holding write that is not a replayed owner action leaves the accrual bytes (order, tier, flags, founded ts/day, last owner action through food shortfall) as the rules do — the founding SETTLE's founded Hamlet, an owner touch's (Explore, Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Depart) touch at its Clock, anything else unchanged (`HoldingReplayMismatch`). Extra tamper class **H1b** (forged at a non-owner write). An owner action whose Holding another instruction *declares* writable is `MissingData` (no silent skip); a SKIP with post-states but none for its Province is `MissingData`; a panicking builder or verification is `PANICKED` (a failure) | review of W5-D (a +1-food forgery at an EXPLORE_RESULT or SETTLE transaction passed) |
| §8.5 V5 | A Reveal whose arrival bell + 600 s runs past the archive's end is a warning (as an unsettled march already was), not `MissingData` | review of W5-D |
| §8.5 tamper | T13's last resort `t13_forced` (codes only). `verify_core::tamper::run_suite_with_fixtures`: a class the run cannot express is judged on the committed fixtures and labelled (`frontier-verify tamper --fallback-fixtures DIR [--strict]`; `frontier-stack tamper` runs this suite, so T23b, H1 and H1b count there). A missed extra class fails the CLI. The suite is asserted on two independent program recordings (`march-program.json.gz` at the integ head, `march-program-dc1281c3.json.gz` from the wave base) | review of W5-D (on a fresh recording T13 was not applicable; the stack kept its own class list) |
| §8.5 checks of checks | `mutate.sh` relinks the default `frontier-verify` on exit; a `mutate-*` binary prints MUTATED BUILD and exits 2 unless `FRONTIER_VERIFY_ALLOW_MUTATED=1` | review of W5-D |
| §8.4 findex | A crash inside the herald's group commit rolls the SQLite index back to the durable archive (`Index::truncate_to`), never a rebuild from seq 0 | review of W5-C |
| §13.4 criterion 6 | Viewer targets are judged on the p99 bucket's **upper** bound; ingest → WS on the WS messages' own stamp when timed (fold lag the labelled fallback); WS gaps fail; 404 for per-bell files of bells without a change are counted apart (§8.4's answer, not an error). **The in-run viewer window of `up --viewers` is the criterion-6 evidence** (`load/in-run.verdict.json`); a `load` after `up` is labelled post-play | review of W5-B and W5-C |
| §13.4 (report) | `frontier-stack report` decides the criteria it can (pass / fail / n.a. with the reason) and exits 1 when one fails; settlement is counted per (host, depart) exactly once; effective N is judged in every bell for both keepers | review of W5-B |
| §13.4 adversary | Holds aim at pending work (slot holds: a Province with arrivals due today; lag: the origin of a march in flight; ticket: through its cohort's 24 bells) and the report shows each hold's effect (held keys written inside the window and after it). `frontier-fund` and `defence-pool` holds are not yet tied to a ring opening or a claim grace (open, W6-C) | review of W5-B |
| §8.7, §12 | `--beacon archive` reads the archive's manifest: it must start at the run's G0 and reach the run's end (else exit 2); an unfinished archive is **PENDING (fetch in progress), exit 4** — PENDING-OWNER (exit 3) stays for Mode R. `--expect-so-sha256` pins the release build for V2 | review of W5-B (O-M1-12 item 3 is approved; the block is the fetch) |
| §9.5 web | The phone sheet ignores only a click inside 400 ms of a drag (a touch drag has none) and captures the pointer; the bell sheet prints a region only when it has one (the controller names a gathered transit's region); province boundaries are a two-tone stroke (paper halo under ink) with ≥ 3:1 against every fill, computed in a test; the relay quota line is in "More" on phones; the matrix fails on "null", "undefined", "NaN", an empty separator or (English) a doubled word | review of W5-E |
| §12 | `permutation-gateway` `npm test` also runs `screens/logic.screen.mjs` (browser-free), so the page logic has a test without the Playwright cache | review of W5-E |

## 26. Amendments v1.10 (integ-W6, 2026-09-29, wave-6 pass 1)

Made in the wave-6 integration window (§3.4). Normative from v1.10. Decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part Q; the record is `integ-W6-NOTES.md`; the code landed on `frontier/m1-integ` in the wave-6 unit merges and the integ-W6 commits. The 7-day `w6-s7` season was not run in this pass (the wave note: the main session runs `scripts/m1-run-s7.sh`, then a triage pass).

| Section | Change | Why / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| I-14, O-M1-04, §5.5, §10.2 | **Phase B committed** (`CLASH_VERSION` 3, W6-B): ResolveFromInputs gate **290,000** in force (G1 maximum 271,673, limit 285,500; release mean 225,731); CloseClashInputs limit 8,000; the worst-case clash bound 410k. Every outcome vector, golden test, fixture and recording regenerated by its owner (integ-W6 commits `c83cb4d`, `e5bb98f`) | W6-B notes §2–§4; the doctrine proxy gate and the bot criterion re-passed with deltas reported (W6-B §2.4) |
| §3.2 | `RULESET_HASH` = `72c6b5835ded6418ed98b0c00b2ae45ce4c4b082d9614447dbce2c9d2e654bd9` (Phase B) | W6-B §2.2 |
| §12 Gate W1 pass conditions, §25 §7 row | "`Occupancy::EMPTY` digests identical to `d95fa25`" → identical to the Phase B recording; tests renamed `occupancy_empty_keeps_the_phase_b_digests`, `m1_rules_keep_the_phase_b_digests` (the old values in their doc comments, the new ones cross-checked on W5-A's independent Phase B lab tree); `engagements_keep_the_v9_retaliation_rules` halving tolerance 1 → 3 with the rounding bound written in the test (it only held for the Phase A dice) | W6-B §2.2, deviations |
| §5.8 CloseSeedCache, §5.11 CloseClashInputs / CloseArrivalDay / CloseArrivalSlot, §8.2 | **Keeper-float close rules (closes §24's open item and N11's architect item):** on the Closed tombstone each closes at once (canonical target, `rent_to`, `CLOSE` at `NO_BELL`); CloseSeedCache does not read the archive there; with the Season Ended ≥ 72 h or on the tombstone CloseClashInputs and CloseArrivalDay do not read the Province (canonical address only, may be absent; the CloseProvince-first hole); CloseArrivalSlot does not read the anchor in its season-end case (b) or on the tombstone | W6-B §3; `keeper_float_closes_on_the_tombstone` |
| §8.2 bid policy (A1) | D and N resend cadence: `d_resend_slots` (2) while the bid rises, `cap_resend_slots` (16) at the class cap, at once after a known failure; W writes every slot; contested detection every slot. The 64-version cap is no longer reached by a 240-slot hold (`held_accounts::anchor_held_past_the_version_cap_lands_after_the_hold` now asserts the landing within one cadence of the hold's end; the cap-and-expiry path stays in `engine::tests`) | W6-C §1.1, D2; W5-B F4 (13–40 SkipQuiet per province-day p99, many losing versions) |
| §8.2 quiet skip (A2) | Target-bell batching (in place above) | W6-C §1.1; nightly SkipQuiet per idle province-day 6 max, churned reported |
| §8.2 payer care (A3) | Cadence on game time and at once when low; new `keeper.toml` keys `care_every_game_secs`, `d_resend_slots`, `cap_resend_slots` (documented in `m1/RUN-A-KEEPER.md`, W6-E) | W6-C §1.2; W5-B F1 |
| §8.5 V5 (A4) | `ValidSealUnrevealed` only for `ROUTED`; `liveness.unrevealed_by_rule` | W6-C §1.6; W5-C F4, N11 |
| §13.4 adversary (A5) | **Closed** (v1.9 §25 open item): the `frontier-fund` hold aims at a ring opening (`fclient::land::ring_opening`), the `defence-pool` hold at an open claim grace (`fclient::play::open_claim`), both armed over the whole play window; the report shows each hold's effect | W6-C §1.4; DECISIONS O11 |
| §8.6 bots (A6) | `--day0-share`, `--eager-personas`, the chain Clock via `--rpc`; `frontier-stack up` passes them below one game day or with `eager_bots = true` (`configs/nightly.toml`); the bots' persona results carry the route (`action@route:result`) and the `late_revealer` verdict leaves a keeper-route 202 (queued, never sent at or after `A + W − 2` slots) out as no evidence either way (integ-W6 `a5be39f`; recording a direct transaction's landing stays open, W6-C F1) | W6-C §1.3, F1; W6-A F-A5/F-A8 (300 bots made no march in 6 game hours) |
| §13.4 criterion 3 | **Reference points pinned** (in place above): round → anchor and S → first cache from the first slot that shows the round public (slots) / from publication (game seconds); **close → resolve judged as S → resolve** (from `S(b, r)` public). The scale-2 latency run: round → anchor 2.0 game s, S → first cache 2.0 s, anchor → last reveal 0 s, S → resolve 3 s (p99; targets 5 / 5 / 30 / 60), close → resolve 65 s reported (= Δ 60 + delay 1 + the cache and the resolve landings); idle province-days ≤ 3 SkipQuiet, churned up to 18 (reported) | W6-A §1 (F5); integ-W6 `7b9995f`; `runs/integ-w6-latency/report.md` |
| §13.4 criterion 1, criterion 3 catch-up (report) | The report decides ClashInputs closability (closable after grace / pending / blocked; a blocked one fails criterion 1) and splits SkipQuiet per province-day into idle and churned by `roster_epoch`; the `.so` pin and the verifier's E6 wall time are printed | W6-A §1; DECISIONS O11 |

| §13.6 (web) | The onboarding page auto-nudges the keeper once per bell while the home province lags, with one retry after a `NotResident` refusal (not for Depart); the herald serves `permutation-server/web` under `/frontier/`, so the game page is `/frontier/frontier/index.html` (`/` and `/frontier` still redirect to the v9 page: W6-D F7, open for W6-C / the triage pass).

## 27. Amendments v1.11 (integ-W6r, 2026-09-29, wave-6 review response)

Made in the wave-6 integration window (§3.4) in answer to the wave-6 review of W6-D and W6-E. Normative from v1.11. Decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part R; the record is `integ-W6r-NOTES.md`; the code is the integ-W6r commits on `frontier/m1-integ`. The 7-day `w6-s7` season is still the main session's (wave note).

| Section | Change | Why / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| §8.2 payers (I-49) | **`F_r` is priced at the requested Reveal:** `fee(P_def, reveal)` uses the budgets table's Reveal CU limit and `L(reveal)` (26,500 CU / 1,146,880 B on the canonical table) with a first reveal's 3 write locks — 2,655,260 lamports per reveal, DESIGN §22.4's figure. The keeper's `Payers::with_budgets` reads the table it sends with (a `budgets_file` moves the floor with it). At the code default (R99 4,000, N 150) `F_r` = 215,076,060 lamports (was 214,942,572: the §5.5 gate at the 1-MiB placeholder, 2 locks). Ceiling 2 F_r, effective N, top-ups: unchanged | W6-E F1 (review "missing" item, confirmed in `keeper/src/pools.rs`); `pools::tests::reveal_floor_is_priced_at_the_requested_reveal`; the stack's payers start at 0.35 SOL, inside the band |
| §12 Gate W6 note (c) | `run-onboarding.sh --spectator` runs the stack for **2 game days** (`--days 2`); the header states it. A 1-day stack (144 play + 26 drain bells, `pause_at_end`) pauses at bell 170; the onboarding runs end at bell ≈ 23 and the spectator's 24 game hours need the chain alive until ≈ 168 | W6-D review (major); the combined path run once in integ-W6r (notes §4) |
| §13.6 (the live onboarding run) | The run judges cut-off content, the three landmarks and the bell chip on every shot as the screen matrix does; only the two "not yet" 404 shapes (`/h/bell/{b}/region/{r}`, `/h/province/{P},{Q}/{b}`; W6-D F8) are benign reads, every other 4xx/5xx under `/h/` is a problem with its URL; the per-shape counts stay in `summary.json` | W6-D review (minor) |
| I-47 (refile callout) | The page keeps the filing bell with the last ticket (`lastTicketBell`) and counts the ticket as seen 3 bells after it when it never saw the ticket open (a ticket ends between two 30-s polls at 20×, or with the tab hidden), so the refile callout is no longer suppressed for that wallet until a new ticket | W6-D review (minor); `web-frontier-march.test.mjs` |
| §26 row "§8.2 payer care (A3)" | Now true: `m1/RUN-A-KEEPER.md` §3 (D/N resend cadence), §4.3 (game-time payer care, the floor's pricing), §5 (`care_every_game_secs`, `d_resend_slots`, `cap_resend_slots` with defaults), §7 (reference numbers from the merged tree's nightlies) | W6-E review (major) |
| CL-26 / E8 evidence (§13) | `m1/c4-v3/svm-reveal-cu.log` committed (the review found it referenced but missing); `c4_model_v3_final.py` priced at the **merged** table (ResolveFromInputs 285,500 → 287,400 cost units; D18 (A) 0.153 / 0.717 SOL, keepers' own spend 0.037 / 0.175 SOL; (B), the pool verdicts and C4 unchanged); the in-play sample 18 → **416 Reveals** (p50 18,743 / p99 22,207 / max 22,355 program CU; whole-transaction max 22,805; the re-run's three nightlies and the latency run included); DESIGN §6.3, §8.3, §22.1–§22.5 updated; worst-case clash 410k everywhere | W6-E review (major, minor) |
| §13.6 / web design §4.2 (open, triage pass) | The spectator page's measured rate is **40 requests per bell per viewer** (`/h/season` and `/h/events` at the 30-s poll, 2,881 each per real day; 3 overview reads) against §4.2's ≈ 13 immutable files: the herald capacity input or the live poll cadence must change; and the season-scale spectator check (web.md §13, 1,000 bots with the §4.2 rate) belongs to `w6-s7` | W6-D review (minor, missing) |
| W6-E notes §2 | The c4 clash counts do depend on Phase B's variance stream, by ≤ 2 per bell at 10k (re-run on the merged tree, integ-W6r notes §2); the 50k × 3 and relics inputs are re-run in the triage pass | W6-E review (minor) |

## 28. Amendments v1.12 (the `w6-s7` triage, 2026-09-30, wave-6 fix units U1–U5)

The 7-day, 1,000-bot, real-round `w6-s7` season (Gate W6's line on `frontier/m1-integ` = `codex/frontier` `7dcacdf`, release `.so` `072b1205…a98b`, 20×, chaos, adversary, 5,000 viewers) completed all 1,008 bells and the drain, but `verify`, `tamper` and `report` exited 1: criterion 1 (9 transits due and unsettled, V5 `MissingData` × 9), V11 `CampMismatch` × 2, criterion 3 (p99 6 / 5 / 13 slots against 2 / 2 / 8; 36 idle province-days over 6 SkipQuiet), criterion 4 (27 `ValidSealUnrevealed`) and criterion 6 (error rate 0.26 %); 37,042 of 177,765 transactions failed. The triage (`scratchpad/frontier/m1/triage/PLAN.md` and its five write-ups) found one rule gap, one verifier bug, keeper implementation causes, a bot bug, a load-generator gap and three criterion wordings; it cut five fix units (§11 wave-6 paths, merge order U1 → U2 → U3 → U4 → U5). Normative from v1.12. Decisions are in `DECISIONS.md` part S; each unit's record is `m1/W6T-<n>-NOTES.md`; the run log is `.claude/data/w6-s7-run.log` and the run directory `frontier-node/.local/frontier/w6-s7`. U1's measurements were filled at the merge (integ-W6t, 2026-09-30; `docs/frontier/m1/checks/w6t_docs_check.py --final` passes). The last rows (integ-W6t) are the integration window's: one verifier strengthening and the R3/R5 record; the record is `m1/integ-W6t-NOTES.md`.

## 29. Amendments v1.13 (integ-W6t review response, 2026-09-30)

A review of integ-W6t (one blocker, three majors) was checked against the code and the `w6-s7`, R3 and R5 data; all four were confirmed and fixed on `frontier/m1-integ` (commits `dcfece9` … `629d007` and the docs commit after them). The record is `m1/integ-W6t-review-NOTES.md`; the 3-day rehearsal on the fixed tree is `runs/integ-w6t-rv-3d/run.md`. Decisions S26–S29.

| Section | Change | Why / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| §13.4 criterion 3 (A1 as amended) | An idle province-day also had no resident action (Muster, Dissolve, Garrison, Explore or Depart naming the Province, landed or refused) and no keeper-served nudge on that day or in the 26 bells before; such days are reported as `resident`. The season-end flush (the SkipQuiet with `b0 + n ≥ end_bell`) is not counted | The reviewer traced `w6-s7`'s 24 days that still failed under A1: 58 short batches, none from a pending op, muster, Leave, departure or arrival; 49 were followed within 15 game minutes by an EXPLORE landing there (a bot's `residency_gate` nudge before Explore: a resident action that leaves `roster_epoch` unchanged), 6 were the season-end flush at bell 1007, 3 unexplained. U2 kept the nudge split by design (`skip_target` returns the live edge), so U2/U3 removed none. Re-reported with the amended rule (`frontier-stack report` on a copy of the run): idle days over 6 **24 → 1**; the one left, (-2,0) day 5, has two splits ending exactly at their landing bell − 2 with no arrival, departure or pending op (a nudge's signature; `w6-s7`'s keeper did not publish nudges). Tests `nudged_or_resident_day_is_not_idle`, `season_end_flush_and_refused_resident_actions` |
| §8.2 keeper status | `/v1/status` `play.nudges_recent`: the nudges taken `[P, Q, bell]` over the last 288 bells; the stack report unions them over the per-bell samples of both keepers | The report could not see nudges (review finding 1); a nudge with no resident action after it (the bot's session gave up) is one split the report must still attribute.

| §13.4 environment (adversary) | `slots-below` priced 1,900 (was 1,500): between the keepers' third Reveal bid (1,732) and their cap (2,000), so the delayed Reveal lands on the fourth version, ≥ `lateness_slots` after the anchor, and opens a claim. `slots-below` is also re-armed while `defence-pool` waits: a bell after a window that opened no claim, only on a bell the fleet sealed a march to, at most 12 times, while the window, a claim and the defence hold fit before the end of play; a re-armed hold that finds nothing is `hold-rearm-expired` (reported), not `hold-skipped`. The hold decisions are one function (`adversary::decide_holds`) the supervisor executes | `defence-pool` needs a claim: a Reveal landing ≥ `lateness_slots` (4) after its anchor. The keepers bid 433, 866, 1,732, 2,000 in the slots after their first version (a slot after the anchor at the earliest), so at 1,500 the third version won 3 slots after the anchor: a claim opened only when a keeper started late. `defence-pool` was hold-skipped in integ-W6t's R3 and nightly 3, and the first 3-day rehearsal of this pass (at 1,500, re-arm only) re-armed 12 windows over bells 40–88 without a claim (aborted at bell ≈ 130, `.local/frontier/integ-w6t-rv-3d-aborted-1500`).

| §8.4 WS, §13.4 criterion 6 (report) | Every WS message carries the send stamp `s` (unix ms when the socket's batch was handed to it); `frontier-viewers` reads its sockets buffered, reads `seq`/`s`/`t` without parsing the payload, and reports ingest → WS with its two shares (herald `s − t`, delivery receipt − `s`) and the file p99 of the answered (200/304) requests; the stack's load verdict prints them (reported, not judged). The herald saves its checkpoints on a blocking worker without holding the ingest (one in flight) | R5's 2.49 s tail: the pre-fix generator on R5's burst replay 3.28 s, the fixed one 0.75 s, herald share 0.69 s, delivery 0.09 s (O-M1-28). R5's fold lag reached 20–25 s three times: `Ingest::step` awaited the checkpoint save; test `checkpoints_save_in_the_background` (5 steps with a 1.5-s save pause take < 1.4 s). 44 % of R5's requests were 404s (the not-yet shapes); the answered p99 is now its own line |
| §13.4 criteria 5 and 8 (report) | Decided only when exercised (see the criteria's v1.13 text): 5 is n.a. when a persona is `pending`, never exercised, or refused with an unnamed code; 8 checks each due garbage / bad-plaintext marchbook transit settled `BAD_SEAL` (bad plaintext with code 5) and is n.a. with none of either kind. `frontier-bots` keeps an earlier lifetime's report as `report-life-<n>.json`; the report merges them (the strongest verdict, counts added). A late_revealer's `AlreadyDone` or `TransitState` is a refusal; a forged settle refused `TransitState`/`AlreadyDone` (a keeper settled first) is no evidence. The settle racer races its settlement: from the bell after its arrival bell it polls every 8 game seconds and tries its re-depart at each poll (the relay's simulation refuses the early tries, which do not count) | R5 passed 4, 5 and 8 vacuously: 490 of 1,000 bots joined, 42 Departs, no garbage, bad-plaintext or settle-racer transit (`bad_seal_codes` {}), personas `needs-chain` or `pending`. `w6-s7`'s `bots/report.json` covered only the last of four fleet lifetimes (2,107 steps). Re-reported, `w6-s7` gives 8 **pass** (15 garbage + 5 bad-plaintext transits, codes 2 and 5) and 5 **n.a.** (its old single-lifetime report). The racer never tried its re-depart at 20× (the 3-day rehearsal; `w6-s7`, R5: pending): its window between the resolve and the keepers' SettleTransit is a few slots, and it ran 0–20 s into each bell; the 20× check `runs/integ-w6t-rv-racer/` observes `HostInTransit`.

| §13.4 (record) R5's limits | R5 (`--days 1 --season-end-at-play-end`) is not evidence for criteria 4, 5 or 8, nor for criterion 3's idle days or criterion 6 at the exit load: the season's `join_close_bell` was scaled to 108 while the bots' one-day mix deals late joins from bell 145, so only day-0 joiners could join (490 JOIN, 452 TICKET against `w6-s7`'s 1,000 / 1,004); 42 Departs; its load matched `w6-s7` day 0 (10,468 transactions), not days 4–6 (25–27k a day) | Review finding 4; `runs/integ-w6t-tri-20x/run.md` "Limits" |
