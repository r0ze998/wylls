export const ORDER_REFERENCE = `Orders are JSON objects with a "type". Coordinates are axial hexes [q, r].
Each order belongs to one office (V5): General = armies and scouts (MoveUnit of non-settlers, Attack, Raze, unit SetStanding),
Steward = cities and settlers (SetQueue, SetFocus, Purchase, FoundCity, MoveUnit of settlers, city SetStanding), Science = SetResearch,
Diplomat = war, treaties, envoys, transfers, markets. Each office has its own budget (a share of 3 + cities, max 8) and bank.
Each order costs 1 (ExchangeOrder, RevealRationale, ConsentWar, ConsentSpend cost 0). One manual order per unit per tick.
A batch holds at most 24 orders (counting the orders of the proposals it adopts), at most 8 of them free; an adoption over that is skipped.

  OfferContract   {to?, term, usdc, deadline}             escrow treasury USDC; paid by the program when the world shows the term by the deadline, else returned.
                  term: {kind:"Peace"} (to makes peace with you) | {kind:"LeaveAlliance", with} | {kind:"KeepNap", every, installments} (paid in parts while your NAP with to stands)
                        | {kind:"Capture", city} (no "to": whichever nation takes that city is paid). Counts as treasury spending; received USDC cannot be spent on the market.

export const RULES_BRIEF = `Wylls: one shared hex world of up to ${NATIONS.length} nations, simultaneous ticks. You are a member of one nation (humans and AI alike, same rights).
Members elect four officers every 30 ticks: general, steward, science officer, diplomat. Only an officer's orders reach the world, each within its office.
Every member proposes orders to an office, supports proposals, votes, and recalls idle officers (a majority of recently active members).
An officer who adopts a proposal shares its merit half and half with the proposer. Officers seal a rationale with every batch; it is revealed later.
Every tick all nations' orders resolve together, in a fixed phase order; submission order does not matter. Information is perfect: every nation sees the whole world (it is public on chain). Orders are sealed: a commitment before the tick's deadline, the orders revealed after it, so nobody can react to them in the same tick.
Nations climb four paths — Hegemony (territory, conquests), Prosperity (population, wealth), Science (techs, Star Gate), Concord (treaties, city-states, trade) —
through five milestone tiers; two paths at a tier (three at tier 5) make an era. Achievement points split the prize pool among nations;
inside a nation, 20% goes equally to active members and the rest by merit (what each member's orders and adopted proposals achieved).
Some members are the operator's AI members; who they are is revealed only after the season, and their prize goes to the other members of their nation.
Each lives in one of its nation's cities (fixed at tick 45, secret): the first nation to conquer that city afterwards earns its bounty.
Nations can bind promises with treasury USDC (OfferContract); words alone bind nothing.`;
