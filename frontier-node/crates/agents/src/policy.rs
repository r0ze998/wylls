//! Bot policies (M1 contract §8.6; offchain design §9): heuristics
//! re-implemented from the simulator's `sim.rs` (`session`, `economy`,
//! `expand`, `war`, `camp_raid`, `pick_stance`) over an [`Observation`],
//! plus the thirteen adversarial personas.
//!
//! [`decide`] is a pure function of (seed, agent, observation, memory): it
//! draws from `Rng::fork(seed, index ‖ bell)`, so the same inputs give the
//! same [`Intent`]s (the determinism test). The runner (`frontier-bots`)
//! turns intents into transactions, sends them through the relay and
//! updates the [`Memory`] from what came back.
//!
//! Order of a decision (the simulator's `session`: defence and duties
//! first, then the economy, then war):
//! 1. not joined → Join (from the agent's join bell);
//! 2. duties on own marches: owner reveal in the arrival bell (a
//!    profile-dependent share, `1 − withhold`), SettleTransit when due;
//! 3. no holding → FileTicket (sites in the own wedge's outer rings);
//! 4. a final holding, in a session: harvest, build, train, muster, explore
//!    and its settlement, then a march (camp raid or war) with the
//!    profile's aggression; personas change or add intents here.
